<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Undefined Product</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Undefined Product</H1><P>The KAES program has determined that one or more kin termproducts are undefined in the kin term map where it appears that aproduct should be defined.  This is a warning and not necessarily anerror in the kin term map.  If the products should be defined, go tothe Construct option under the Describe option and put in the appropriateconnector (arrow or the equal sign) between the kin terms in question.</P></BODY></HTML>
