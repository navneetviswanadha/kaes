<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Change Arrow Linkage</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Change Arrow Linkage</H1><P>The kin term map has two arrows with the same kin termassociated with each arrow.  This can occur when the arrowsrepresent sex marked kin term products, but the kin termused to represent the products does not have a sexmarking.  An example is the Trobriand terminology wherearrows downward arrows can be used to represent takingproducts with the implicit terms, "Son" and "Daughter",but the terminology only has a single term that can beglossed "Child".</P><P>If this kin term is now bifurcated into a pair ofterms, for example by using the equivalent term notationto represent the term, and the new terms are now sexmarked, the association of terms with arrows will needto be changed as well.</P><P>The KAES program has identified the a single kinterm is associated with a pair of arrows, and the kinterm is now being bifurcated into a pair of terms throughmaking an equivalent term into a distinct kin term.  Thenew association between kin terms and arrows will needto be consistent with the sex associated with the arrowsand the sex associated with the new terms.  Select Yesif the suggested new pattern for linking kin terms witharrows is correct.  Otherwise, select No, use the Changeoption to Reset the linkage of kin terms with thearrows in question, and then use the Construct KintermMap option to reassign kin terms to the arrows inquestion.</P></BODY></HTML>
