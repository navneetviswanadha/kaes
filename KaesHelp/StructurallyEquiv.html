<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Structurally Equiv.</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Structurally Equiv.</H1><P>Two kin terms are structurally equivalent if the patternof arrows to and from one kin term is matched by the pattern ofarrows to and from the other kin terms.  For example, Motherand Father are structurally equivalent kin terms in the AKTsince each arrow to Father, such as Self --> Father, is matchedby an arrow to Mother; e.g., Self --> Mother, and similarlyfor arrows going from Father to a kin term.</P></BODY></HTML>
