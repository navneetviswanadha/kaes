<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Compare Options</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Compare Options</H1><P>The options may be used to draw small window versions ofkin term maps and algebra structures for visual and analyticalcomparison.  Use the Files option to change the active file forcomparison of several kin term maps and algebra structures.  Movethe graph out of the work window that will appear when more thanone graph is to be drawn.</P><H3>ALGEBRA</H3><P>Select this option to draw the algebra structure for thecurrent active file.</P><H3>KIN TERM MAP</H3><P>Select this option to draw the kin term map for thecurrent active file.  </P><H3>PRODUCT TABLE</H3><P>Select this option to display a product table for theactive file.  The product table displays, in tabular form, theresult of taking the product of any element in the algebra (orkin term map) with an atomic element (or kin term).</P><H3>ISOMORPHISM</H3><P>Select this option to compare a kin term map and analgebraic structure to see if they are isomorphic as structures. The kin term names and the algebraic elements need not be thesame. When they are different, you will be prompted to providethe correspondence between atomic elements and kin term names.</P><P>The map and algebra to be compared must first be drawn onthe screen.  After the Isomorphism option is selected you will bequeried for the kin term map and the algebraic structure that areto be compared if more than one algebra or more than one kin termmap has been drawn on the screen.  Click on the kin term map andalgebraic structure to be compared.</P><P>If the map and the structure are not isomorphic the KAESprogram will so inform you and indicate why isomorphism fails. Use this information to decide if either the kin term map or thealgebraic structure are incompletely specified.  If necessary, goback to the kin term map to draw in parts of the map that mayhave been omitted, or to the algebraic construction to modify theform of the algebraic structure.</P></BODY></HTML>
