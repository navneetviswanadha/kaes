<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Two Generators</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Two Generators</H1><P>In an algebraic structure, each generating element willcorrespond to a distinct arrow. The fact that there are twotypes, with respect to direction and color, of arrows leadingfrom the focal term suggests that two generators will be neededfor constructing the algebraic structure.   For example, in thereduced structure of male marked kin terms for the TrobriandTerminology there is one type of arrow going from theterm, Tuwa ("Older Brother"), to the kin term, Tama ("Father"),and another type of arrow going from Tuwa to Tuwa (that is, areflexive arrow).  This suggests the use of two generators, whichcould be labeled F ("Father") and B ("Older Brother") for mnemonicpurposes, in the algebraic structure.</P><P>Other generating elements, such as reciprocal elements forthe two generators, may need to be added to the algebra at a later stepin the construction process.  For example, for the reduced structureof male marked kin terms in the Trobriand Terminology, the reciprocalof the kin term, Tama ("Father"), is the kin term, Latu ("Son"),and the reciprocal of the kin term, Tuwa ("Older Brother") is thekin term, Bwada ("Younger Brother").  After the initial algebra isconstructed based on two generating elements, e.g., F and B, additionalelements, call them S and b (mnemonic for "Son" and "Younger Brother"),are added to the algebraic structure along with appropriate equationsto make them the algebraic reciprocals of the algebraicelements, F and B, respectively.  These equationsare: (Bb)(Bb) = (Bb) = (bB)(bB) (with the element, Bb, mapped to thekin term, Luta ("Brother"), the kin term used by females for alterswho are male siblings) and FS = Bb.</P><P>Note: The terms Tuwa and Bwada in the Trobriand terminologyare also used by female egos for female alters and these terms wouldthen be glossed as "Older Sister" and "Younger Sister,"respectively.  The term Luta is used by male egos for female alters andwould then be glossed as "Sister."  The term Latu is also used forfemale alters by both male and female egos.</P><P>Yet other generating elements may need to be added toincorporate properties such as affinal elements.  For example, inthe Trobriand Terminology an element, H, is added, that satisfies thealgebraic criterion for a Husband element.  The reciprocalelement, W, is automatically generated by the KAES program along with theequation HH = 0 = WW and the reciprocal defining equation(HW)(HW) = HW.</P><P>The construction process is an incremental one in whichan initial structure can be elaborated upon.  Alternatively, ifprior work makes it clear that an element and its reciprocal willboth be needed in the structure, it is possible to begin withtwo generating elements, say P and C.  The program will querythe user as to which one, if either, should be the reciprocalelement unless these two symbols correspond to kin terms in aKin Term map where neither element is the reciprocalof the other.  For example, for the Trobriand Terminology thegenerating elements are F ("Father") and B ("Older Brother") andif the KinTerm Map is active, the KAES program will recognize thatthe symbols F and B should not be reciprocal elements in thealgebraic structure.</P></BODY></HTML>
