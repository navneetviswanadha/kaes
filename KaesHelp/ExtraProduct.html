<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Extra Product</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Extra Product</H1><P>More than one product using the same kin term has been definedin the kin term map.  This makes the product a 'one-to-many' mapping,hence ambiguous as to what the kin term product equals.  Some kinterm products have this kind of ambiguity, so it need not be an error.However, it will require special consideration when constructing thealgebraic model as the algebraic product is assumed to be a 'one-to-one'or a 'many-to-one' mapping, not a 'one-to-many' mapping.#L0000</P><P>Two examples of different ways a one-to-many productoccurs can be seen in the AKT.  First, Parent of Self in the AKTcould either be Mother or Father.  Here the ambiguity is not at astructural level, but arises when a kin term defined at one level(e.g. Parent as an atom and without sex marking) is used at adifferent level (e.g., at the level where kin terms have sex marking).In the algebraic construction, the difference in these levels ismade apparent through first constructing the algebra based on thegenerators P and I, then expanding upon this structure and introducingsex marking of algebraic elements at a later stage in the construction.#L0000</P><P>Second, Father of Second Cousin Once Removed can either beGreat Uncle or Second Cousin, depending upon the genealogicalrelationship of alter1 to ego.  If, for instance, alter1 is ego'sfffss, then ego would refer to alter as Second Cousin Once Removed.  Ifalter2 is ego's fffs, then alter1 would refer to alter2 as Father andego would refer to this alter2 as Great Uncle.  On the otherhand, if alter1 is ego's fffssss, then ego would also refer to alter1as Second Cousin Once Removed.  If alter2 is ego's fffsss, then alter1would refer to alter2 as Father, and ego would refer to this alter2as Second Cousin.  In this instance, the introduction of a one-to-manymapping occurs at a more "surface level" aspect of the model.#L0000</P><P>In the algebraic construction of a model for the AKT, the"Ith Cousin, J times removed" nomenclature is introduced at the endof the construction process via an equation that "folds over" thegeneral cousin structure so as to create the "Ith Cousin, J TimesRemoved" nodes in the algebraic structure.  At this point the modelthe algebraic structure takes on a one-to-many property.</P></BODY></HTML>
