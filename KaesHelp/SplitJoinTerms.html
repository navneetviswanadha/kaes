<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Split/Join Terms</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Split/Join Terms</H1><P>Equivalent terms differ only at the level of labelsand are treated analytically as if they are a singleterm.  If one kin term is called, XYZ, then the equivalentkin term will be labeled "XYZ".  Each label may be locatedin the kin term map.  This allows for simplication of themap when a kin term has arrows from disparate parts of thekin term map.  For example, the kin term First Cousin TwiceRemoved is also a self-reciprocal term in the AKT and sothere will be two sets of arrows for this kin term.  Byusing equivalent terms, one label, First Cousin TwiceRemoved, can be at one node and the other label,"First Cousin Twice Removed", can be at the reciprocalnode.</P><P>Another use of equivalent terms occurs when itappears that a kin term has been constructed by "collapsingtogether" what were two distinct kin terms.  In theShipibo terminology, for example, the sex neutral term,ea ("Self"), appears to be the collapsing together oftwo nodes, "Male Self" and "Female Self".  In this case theequivalent terms, ea and "ea", could be used torepresent Male Self and Female Self, respectively.  Thisis useful when the kin term map is seperated into malekin term versus female kin terms.</P><P>The Split option allows you to click on a kin termin the kin term map.  The KAES program then generates theequivalent term and places it in the kin term map.</P><P>The Join option allows you to click on what arenow two distinct kin terms and join (or collapse) thentogether to form a pair of equivalent terms.  After selectingthe Join option, you will be asked to select the firstkin term of the pair.  Then you will be asked to select thesecond kin term of the pair.  The effect of making this pairof terms equivalent will not be seen until you exit from theConstuct option and reselect the Construct option.  Thelabeling for the pair of terms will be based on the firstterm that was selected.</P><P>Note that for a pair of equivalent terms, an arrowof a given type need only be used to connect a kin term withone of the pair of equivalent kin terms since the equivalentterms differ only at the level of labels and are treated asa single term.  Which one, or both, of the equivalent terms isused with connecting arrows is arbitrary from an analyticviewpoint.  When joining terms to form an equivalent pair ofterms, the KAES program does not check to see if any of thearrows are now redundant.  If the same type of arrow noworiginates at the same kin term and points to each of thenewly formed equivalent terms, Erase one of the arrows.</P></BODY></HTML>
