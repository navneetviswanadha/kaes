<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Equivalent Term</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Equivalent Term</H1><P>The term equivalent to another kin term is enclosedin quotation makes and listed in the Workspace window.  The effect ofunsplitting a kin term that has previously been splitinto a term and its equivalent term is to make the term and itsequivalent term into distinct kin terms.  After selectingthe equivalent term that is to be unsplit, you will beasked to provide a new name for the equivalent term.  Youmay use any name other than the name for a kin term alreadyincluded in the kin term map.</P></BODY></HTML>
