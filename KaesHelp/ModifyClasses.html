<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Modify Classes</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Modify Classes</H1><P>Structurally equivalent kin terms are based on the patternof arrows pointing to and from a kin term.  The algorithm takesinto consideration the color of the arrow as well as its direction(upward, downwards or sidewards) and whether it is pointing to orfrom a kin term.  An alternative algorithm may be used that ignoresthe color difference between arrows of the same type, e.g., upwardpointing arrows can be dark or light blue.  If arrow color has beenused, for example, to distinguish the sex of kin term mappings, thenthe alternative algorithm constructs sets of equivalent kin termsignoring the sex marking of kin terms.</P></BODY></HTML>
