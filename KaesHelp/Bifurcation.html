<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Bifurcation</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Bifurcation</H1><P>Bifurcation will cause the non-sex marked element in questionto be replaced by a pair of sex marked elements.  The logicallynecessary implications of this bifurcation will be generatedautomatically.  For example, the pair of sex marked elements willbe structurally equivalent, so the arrows currently pointing toor from the non-sex marked element will be extended, as appropriate,to the pair of sex marked elements that replace the non-sex marked element.</P></BODY></HTML>
