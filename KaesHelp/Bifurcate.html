<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Bifurcate</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Bifurcate</H1><P>Bifurcation allows for an element to be split into twoelements, with arrows originating or terminating at the originalelement carried over to the two new replacement elements. Bifurcation is the obverse of structural equivalence.  When anelement, E, is bifurcated into two new elements, E1 and E2, thenthe new elements E1 and E2 will be structurally equivalent.</P><P>Two kinds of bifurcation are defined: (1) spousebifurcation and (2) gender bifurcation.</P><H3>BIFURCATE BY SPOUSE</H3><P>Bifurcation by spouse is based on the idea that if S is aspouse element and E is an element with SE = E then E should bebifurcated into a pair of sex marked elements.  The KAES programqueries you to see if an element such as S should be bifurcatedinto two elements, call them H and W; whether all elements suchas E should be bifurcated into a pair of sex marked elements; andwhether or not bifurcation should also apply to elements that arethe reciprocal of elements such as E that are to be bifurcated.</P><H3>BIFURCATION BY GENDER</H3><P>Bifurcation by gender bifurcates any element, X, into apair of sex marked elements.</P><P>After the bifurcation operation has been selected andcompleted, you are queried to see if you wish to graph thealgebra to see which elements are bifurcated according to theoptions selected.</P></BODY></HTML>
