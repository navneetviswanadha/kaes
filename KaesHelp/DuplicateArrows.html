<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Duplicate Arrows</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Duplicate Arrows</H1><P>The KAES program has determined that some pairs of kin termsin the kin term map are joined more than once by the same type ofarrow.  The offending pairs of terms and arrow type are displayedin the text window on the right of the screen.  Review the kin termmap and erase any duplicate arrow connecting the same pair of kin terms.</P></BODY></HTML>
