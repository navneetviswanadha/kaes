<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Many Generators</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Many Generators</H1><P>The KAES Program has indentified the possibility that theremay be more than two generators for the kin term map.  The calculationis based on the number of distinct "up" arrows and the number ofdistinct "side" arrows (but pointing only to one side as the other"side" is obtained by reciprocity; e.g., the reciprocal of"Older Brother" -- left side pointing arrow -- is "YoungerBrother" -- right side pointing arrow.</P><P>Most likely, the kin term map is too "complex;" that is,it contains within it simpler substructures from which the completekin term map can be constructed.  For example, in the TrobriandTerminology, the complete kin term map can be reduced to the set ofmale (female) kin terms and construction can begin with thisreduced structure.  Whereas the the complete kin term map requiresfour generators ("Father," "Mother," "Older Brother" and "OlderSister"), the kin term map based on a single sex only needs twogenerators.  Thus, the male marked kin terms are modeled with analgebraic strucuture based on generators corresponding to "Father"and "Older Brother."  The terms with the opposite sex markingare introduced by means of constructing an isomorphic copy of the(male, female) marked structure that becomes the (female, male)marked structure.  When these two strucutures are joined together,the complete kin term map with its four generators can bemodeled.</P></BODY></HTML>
