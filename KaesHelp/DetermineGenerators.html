<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Determine Generators</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Determine Generators</H1><P>The next step is to determine the generators for the algebraicmodel.  The KAES program will make suggestions about numbers ofgenerators that might be needed, and whether or not the kin termmap should be simplified before proceeding.</P><P>In the kin term map, kin terms are assigned to arrowsso that the effect of taking a kin term product can be shownby connecting terms with arrows.  Usually there will need to beone generator for each distinct "up" arrow.  If the "down" arrowsare the reciprocals of the "up" arrows, then generators will notbe needed to correspond to the "down" arrows.  Instead, elementsthat correspond to the "down" arrows will be introduced asreciprocal elements.</P><P>The "side" arrows (left and right) are slight morecomplicated, depending upon whether an Older/Younger distinctionis made.  If a "right" arrow represents a term that is thereciprocal of a "left" arrow (or if the term/reciprocal termrelationship is marked by the color of the arrows), then thenumber of generators needed for the "side" arrows will be 1/2of the total number of side arrows.  As with the "down" arrows,the other "side" arrows will be introduced via reciprocal elements.</P><P>A "Spouse" element (or "Husband" and "Wife" elements) willnormally be introduced as affinal elements and not as generatingelements.</P></BODY></HTML>
