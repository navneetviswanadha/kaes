<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Cousin Removals</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Cousin Removals</H1><P>The English cousin terms employ the "Ith Cousin J timesRemoved" nomenclature.  The nomenclature can be defined usingthe algebraic graph.  Suppose the generating elements are thesymbols P and C, with these symbols corresponding to thekin terms, Parent and Child, respectively.  In the algebraicgraph, the nodes corresponding to Cousin terms are productsof the form CC . . . CPP . . . P, where the product includesat least two C's and at least two P's.  Let I+1 refer to thenumber of P's and J+2 to the number of C's in the product.</P><P>For those nodes where there are an equal numberof C's and P's in the product; i.e., I = J+1, the algebraicproduct corresponds to the term, Ith Cousin.  Note that anIth Cousin is on the same genealogical level as Self orSibling.  Next, if I < J+1 then the product correspondsto the term, Ith Cousin J times Removed.  For example,CCCPP corresponds to First Cousin Once Removed sinceI = 1 and J = 1 (and I = 1 < 2 = J+1).  Finally, inthe English nomenclature for Cousin terms, all Cousin termsare self-reciprocal.  The reciprocal for the productCC . . . CPP . . . P with I+1 P's and J+2 C'sin the product is the product CC . . . CPP . . . Pwith J+2 P's and I+1 C's in the product.  Both of these nodescorrespond to the term, Ith Cousin J times Removed.  Tocontinue with the example, the product CCCPP is thereciprocal for the product CCPPP and so CCCPP also correspondsto the kin term First Cousin Once Removed.  (SeeGatewood, J. 1972.  "A case study of English-American kinshipterminology," Journal of the Steward Anthropological Society3(2):116 - 154 for a more extensive discussion of the EnglishCousin nomenclature.)</P><P>The relationship between the nomenclature and thealgebraic products via reciprocity can be also be shown usingvector notation for the node.  Let (I+1, J+2) be the vectorrepresentation for the product CC . . . CPP . . . P, where theproduct has I+1 P's and J+2 C's and I < J+1.  Then (I+1, J+2)corresponds to the kin term, Ith Cousin J times Removed, and(J+2, I+1) is the vector form for the reciprocal node.  Hence(J+2, I+1) also corresponds to the kin term, Ith Cousin J timesRemoved.  For example, (2, 3) is the vector form for theproduct, CCCPP, and CCCPP corresponds to the kin term, FirstCousin Once Removed.  The reciprocal product is CCPPP whichhas vector form (3, 2) and this product also corresponds to thekin term, First Cousin Once Removed.  Note that in the vectornotation the reciprocal product is obtained by reversing theorder of the two components in the vector.</P></BODY></HTML>
