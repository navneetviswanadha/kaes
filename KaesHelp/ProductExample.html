It is important to observethat the kin term product does not depend upon knowledge of thegenealogical relationships among ego, alter1 and alter2.  Rather,the definition depends upon native knowledge that informs us asto the proper usage of kin terms as terms of reference.  Not allkin term pairs will have a product (for example, Parent ofChild-In-Law does not give rise to a kin term), and some productsmay have more than one kin term as a consequence when there isreference to specific egos and alters (for example, in theAmerican Kinship Terminology, Child of Father could be Son or itcould be Daughter, depending upon the sex of alter2).</P><P>The kin term product is the basis upon which the kin termmap is constructed.  In the kin term map, arrows stand for "atomic"kin terms and nodes are labeled with kin terms, so that an arrowgoing from one node to another makes the assertion that the termsused to label the nodes are related to each other via the kin termproduct.  For example, if one node is labeled Mother, the second nodeis labeled Grandfather and the arrow represents the Father term, thenan arrow from the Mother node to the Grandfather node makes theassertion that "Father of Mother is Grandfather" is a correctstatement about kin terms in the American Kinship Terminology.</P><P>While there is a close connection between the symbols used forgenealogical reckoning and for kin terms in the American KinshipTerminology (e.g., we have the kin term, Child, and the kintype,child, the kin term Father and the kintype father, etc.), there isno necessary reason to assume that kin terms must (a) first be expressedin terms of kin types and (b) second analyzed in terms of kin types ashas been done, for example, with rewrite rules.   The theory uponwhich the KAES program is based argues that kin terms form anabstract, conceptual structure based upon an internal logic whichdetermines the form of the structure.  The goals of the analysis,then, is to make this internal logic apparent and to determine theatomic elements and equations that suffice to permit the structureto be generated as an abstract system of interlinked symbols.  Thekin term product is central to the argument as it provides themotivation for introducing a binary product over the symbols usedin the abstract model for the kinship terminology structure.</P><P>Thus, if the kin terms Self, Parent and Child are determinedto be atomic terms (as the analysis of the American KinshipTerminology demonstrates), then if we use the symbols S, P and Cand introduce a binary product, o, over the set {S, P, C} (where thebinary product can be viewed as a concatenation operation) we willwant all distinct symbol strings in the algebra to correcpond toprecisely the kin terms in the terminology, and any product ofsymbols must have an interpretation as a kin term product based uponthe terms identified with the symbols.  For example, in the algebrabased upon the symbol set {S, P, C}, we can construct (viaconcatenation) the symbol string, P o P o P (or PPP for short) andwe can identify this symbol string with the kin term productParent of Parent of Parent, or GreatGrandParent.</P></BODY></HTML>
