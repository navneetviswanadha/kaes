The AKT has a cross sib structure since, for example, Sonof Sister is Nephew but Daughter of Sister is Niece.  "Parallel Sib"structure corresponds to cases where Son or Daughter of Brother (Sister)is the same kin term.  The Shipibo terminology is an example of parallelsib structure.</P></BODY></HTML>
