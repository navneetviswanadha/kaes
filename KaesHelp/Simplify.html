<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Simplify</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Simplify</H1><P>Although, in principle, it would be possible to build analgebraic model using the number of generators that have beenidentified as being needed, it would also require recognizingin advance the way in which the kin term map can, in fact, bebuilt out of simpler structures.  For this reason any simplicationthat is possible should be done before proceeding.</P><P>Pragmatically simplification is needed since the Proalgprogram will not be able to handle more than 2 generators whenconstructing the initial model.  The limit is due to thecombinatorial problem that arises with regard to the size of thefree algebra (that is, the algebra constructed by taking allpossible products in all possible orders of the generatingelements) that must be constructed.</P></BODY></HTML>
