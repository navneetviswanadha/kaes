<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Distinct Terms</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Distinct Terms</H1><P>Currently, the symbols X and "X" are being used in thekin term map, where X is a kin term and "X" is an equivalentkin term.  Although there are two symbols, the two symbolsactually represent a single kin term.  The two symbols areused to aid in displaying the properties of the kin termmap.</P><P>The KAES program has determined that the algebraicmodel has a pair of sex marked elements that should correspondto a pair of kin terms, but the kin term map has a single,non-sex marked kin term instead.  Since the kin term in questionis being represented by a term and its equivalent term, theKAES program is suggesting that the term and its equivalentterm be made into a pair of kin terms, that is, distinctterms by changing the term "X" into a kin term in itsown right.</P></BODY></HTML>
