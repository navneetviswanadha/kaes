<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Isomorphism</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Isomorphism</H1><P>After the isomorphic algebra has been defined, severalproperties may need to be verified or activated beforeconstructing the new algebra using the options in this menu.</P><H3>GRAPH SCREEN</H3><P>Select this option to display the graph of the algebra.</P><H3>FORMAL ALGEBRA SCREEN</H3><P>Select this option to write the algebraic elements andequations as currently defined in the window on the left.</P><H3>ISOMORPHIC STRUCTURE SCREEN</H3><P>Use this option to write the elements and equations ofthe Isomorphic Algebra, as it has just been defined, in thewindow on left.  The elements and equations will be the same asthose that were in the algebra before the isomorphism option wasselected, except that each element in that algebra will now bereplaced by its corresponding isomorphic element.</P><H3>RECIPROCAL EQUATIONS</H3><P>Use this option to determine if any equations are neededto make a pair of elements reciprocals of each other.</P><H3>RECIPROCAL ELEMENTS (MALE/FEMALE ELEMENTS)</H3><P>If Reciprocal Elements is displayed, use this option todetermine if an algebraic element and its isomorphic elementshould be reciprocals of each other.  The KAES program willdisplay a suggested equation for making a pair of elementsreciprocal elements.</P><P>If Male/Female Elements is displayed instead, it islikely that at this stage in the algebraic construction thealgebra and the isomorphic copy differ from each otherstructurally as male versus female elements.  Selection of thisoption will query whether or not pairs of elements are male andfemale elements, respectively.</P><H3>STRUCTURAL EQUATIONS</H3><P>Selection of this option allows pairs of elements to bemade structurally equivalent.</P><H3>FOCAL ELEMENT</H3><P>If the algebra already has a focal element, selection ofthis option will cause all equations which contain a focalelement to be written in the window on the right.  In addition,identity equations using the focal element will be displayed.  Ifthe algebra does not yet have a focal element, it will bedetermined if a product of elements is a likely candidate forbeing identified as a focal element and if so the program willquery if that product should be considered a focal element forthe algebra.</P></BODY></HTML>
