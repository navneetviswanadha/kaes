When done making changeseither click the right mouse button or click on the "Return"option at the bottom of the screen if one is displayed.</P><H3>POSITION</H3><P>The colored rectangle shows the portion of the graph thatis displayed in the window.  To change the position of the graph,click anywhere inside the black rectangle and while holding downthe left mouse button, drag the red rectangle to the portion ofthe graph that should be displayed.  Now release the left mousebutton. </P><H3>ZOOM</H3><P>Click on the Zoom rectangle to select a multiplyingfactor for the graph.  A factor greater than 1 will make thegraph larger and a factor less than 1 will make the graphsmaller.</P><H3>ROTATION</H3><P>The rotation option only applies to algebraic structures.</P><P>Around the circle are degree markings.  Click on thedegree marking corresponding to the amount the graph should berotated from a horizontal position.  If the graph is atwo-dimensional graph the rotation will be in the two-dimensionalplane.  If the graph is a three-dimensional graph, three axeswill be displayed in the center of the circle.  Select an axisfirst and then the amount to be rotated. </P></BODY></HTML>
