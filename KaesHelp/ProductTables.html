<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Product Tables</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Product Tables</H1><P>The product tables show the result of taking products ofkin terms or of algebraic elements.</P><H3>ALGEBRAIC PRODUCT</H3><P>Select this option to display what is sometimes called aCayley Table.  A Cayley Table is like a multiplication table inthat it shows the result of taking the product of one algebraicelement with another.</P><P>If both an algebraic structure and a kinterm map have already been drawn, then after selecting thisoption you will be queried about how the table should bedisplayed.  The table can either be displayed with the algebraicelements shown via the symbols used as atomic terms whenconstructing the algebra, or with their kinship term equivalents. The former shows the terms that make up the algebra but not howthe algebra relates to the kin term map.  The latter shows whatthe algebraic structure looks like using the kin terms that arethe equivalent of the algebraic terms. </P><P>The equivalence between algebraic elements and kin termsis established through identifying the kin terms that are theequivalent of the atoms in the algebra.  Compound terms (productsof two or more atoms) in the algebra are then identified with akin term by the KAES program by tracing through the kin term mapin a manner corresponding to the products included in thecompound algebraic term.  Thus, if the algebra uses the symbols Pand C for two generators and the correspondence P <--> Parent andC <--> Child is made between algebraic atoms and kin terms, thenthe algebraic compound term CCPP would be identified with the kinterm that is found when one traces two steps away from the termSelf using the Parent kin term and then two additional stepsusing the Child kin term; i.e., with the kin term Cousin for theAKT. </P><H3>KIN TERM MAP</H3><P>The Kin Term Map option provides a table that shows theproducts that are implicitly defined in the Kin Term Map.  Toconstruct the table two types of kin terms need to bedistinguished: (1) a focal kin term for the map and (2) kin termsthat are exactly one step away from the focal term.  Either atthis stage or possibly at an earlier stage, the KAES program willsuggest a possible focal term (or more than one if no singlefocal term is determined by the KAES program) for the kin termmap.  The KAES program will next suggest the kin terms thatshould be used for constructing the Kin Term Table.  Click on theNext option in the menu that appears at the bottom of the screenif the suggestion is to be accepted.  Otherwise, click on the kinterm that should be used instead.</P><P>The Kin Term Map table is constructed independent of thealgebraic table.  This means that isomorphism (or lack thereof)between the Kin Term Map and the Algebraic Structure can bevisually considered by comparing the Algebraic Product tableusing kin terms in its display and the Kin Term Map table.</P><H3>GENEALOGY</H3><P>The genealogy option constructs the kin types includedunder the algebraic elements based on a mapping of the generatingelements to kin types.  The KAES program will suggest kin typescorresponding to generating elements. If the suggestion isincorrect, the correct kin type may be entered from the keyboard. </P><P>For kin types the following convention is used: f =father, m = mother, b = brother, z = sister, s = son, d =daughter, sp = spouse, h = husband and w = wife.  In addition,ego, ego-m and ego-f are also used as kin types, where ego-m andego-f are male ego and female ego, respectively.  Kin typeproducts are written left to right: e.g., mbd would be mother'sbrother's daughter.  For example, if the algebra has elements Pand C, the program may suggest P --> f and C -- > s.  Kin typesfor algebraic elements other than the generating elements arederived from the algebraic element kin type mapping and thealgebraic structure.</P><P>The list of algebraic elements with the corresponding setof kin types is saved in the file, SCRATCH.GEN (and willautomatically be saved as an algebra file if either the Save orSave As option is used).  If this file already exists, the KAESprogram will query if the kin type table is to be displayed or ifa new table is to be generated.  In the latter case, the KAESprogram queries if a shallow or in-depth table is to be compute. The shallow table is computed more quickly, but does not displaythe full range of kin types that may be produced using equationssuch as CCPP = CP (that is, equations that collapse more distantelements onto closer elements).  The construction can be quitelengthy and may take several minutes.</P><P>The KAES program will also query if the kin types b and zshould be used in place of {fs, ms} and {fd, md}, respectively. If both an algebra and its matching kin term map have beenactivated, then the KAES program will query if the algebraicelements should be displayed in the Genealogy Table as algebraicelements or in the form of their kin term equivalents.  Thelatter shows the results of the algebraic analysis in a formatcomparable to the way in which kin terms are often defined interms of kin types.  It needs to be kept clear that the tableproduced by the KAES program has been created solely from thealgebraic structure and the mapping of generating elements to kintypes and thus establishes a mapping from the kin term space tothe genealogical space. </P><P>S</P></BODY></HTML>
