The algebraic products,X o A and X o B, are said to be unbalanced if (1) X o A = Z <> 0 and(2) X o B = 0 or vice versa, where A and B are isomorphic algebraic elements and differ only by sex marking.</P><P>The graphics box displays the algebraic products where the productsare unbalanced.  If X o Y and X o Y' are unbalanced algebraic prodcuts, thena resolution may be made by combining, or collapsing, the two sex marked,algebraic elements Y and Y' into a single, non-sex marked element, denotedby <Y,Y'>.  The Shipibo terminology is an example where unbalanced productsarise and are then resolved via this process.</P></BODY></HTML>
