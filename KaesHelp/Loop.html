<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Loop</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Loop</H1><P>Some terminologies, such as the Trobriand terminology, usethe same kin term for persons in both older and younger generationswith respect to ego.  For example, term that might be transliteratedas "Grandperson" might be used for someone two generations above egoor for someone two generations below ego (thus making the term"Grandperson" a self-reciprocal term).  While it the equation"Father" of "Father" = "Grandperson" might be valid, the kin termproduct "Father" of "Grandperson" is likely to be multivalued, with"Father" of "Grandperson" = "Grandperson" when the term "Father" isused by an alter two generations above ego, whereas "Father" of"Grandperson" = "Child" when the term "Father" is used by an altertwo generations below ego.</P><P>Thus, although the self-reciprocity of the term "Grandparent"creates a loop in the kin term structure, this is not a cyclein the sense the idea of a cycle is normally used as the productsbecome multivalued and do not simply move one around the cycle fromone node to the next indefinitely.  This suggests that the loop isnot a "deep structure" but instead has been induced through twodistinct nodes becoming identified (that is, made into a singlenode) through the use of the same label for both nodes.  The loop,then, is the consequence of how nodes are labeled and is not astructural feature, per se.</P><P>The KAES program has noted that there is a loop andsuggests that the loop should be broken by relabeling the nodesin question with different labels using the Constract KinTermMap option under the Describe option.  For example, if thekinterm in question is "Grandperson", then the single label,"Grandperson" might be changed into "Granperson1" and"Grandperson2", with one label used, say, for the ascendinggeneration node and the other label used for the reciprocal(descending generation) node.</P></BODY></HTML>
