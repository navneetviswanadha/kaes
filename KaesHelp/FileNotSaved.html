TheKAES program only provides a limited set of file operations.  Analternative way to save the scratch files is to exit the KAESprogram (the scratch files will not be erased) and to use the DOSSave command.  Use the command <SAVE SCRATCH.MAP filename.MAP> tosave just the kin term map.  Use the command <SAVE SCRATCH.*filename.*> to save both the kin term map and the algebra scratchfiles.  One way to save just the algebra scratch files is to firstcopy all of the scratch files to a temporary name; e.g.<SAVE SCRATCH.* TEMP.*>, then delete the map file that was justcreated (e.g. <DEL TEMP.MAP> and finally rename the temporary filesto the desired name (e.g. <REN TEMP.* filename.*>.</P></BODY></HTML>
