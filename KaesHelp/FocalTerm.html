<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Focal Term</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Focal Term</H1><P>The criterion used by the KAES program for defining afocal term is similar to the idea of a source in graph theory.  Akin term is a focal term if (a) no arrow points to the kin term(a source in graph theory), or (b) whenever there is an arrowpointing to the kin term there is an arrow of the same kindpointing from the kin term (to be called here a pseudo-source). For a pseudo-source, if we have the pattern, Term 1 ---> FocalTerm, then there must be a Term 2 with Focal Term --> Term 2using the same kind of arrow.  In the AKT, the term Self is afocal term since the (parent) arrow from Child to Self isbalanced by the (parent) arrow from Self to Parent and all otherarrows point from Self to kin terms.</P></BODY></HTML>
