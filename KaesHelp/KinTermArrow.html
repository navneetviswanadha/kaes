If the kin term tobe associated with the arrow is not in the kin termmap, then it may be typed in instead.  An example wherethe kin term to be linked with an arrow is not in the kinterm map may be seen with the American Kinship Terminology(AKT).  In the complete kin term map for the AKT the terms, Parentand Child, do not appear since the map uses the termsFather and Mother instead.  However, the up arrow in thekin term map for the AKT should represent taking productswith the kin term Parent.  At this stage in the constructionof the kin term map for the AKT, the option to type in thekin term to be linked to the up arrow was selected andthe kin term Parent was typed in.</P><P>When the kin term is typed in, it will be added tothe list of kin terms for the terminology.  It does not needto be moved to the kin term map.  If this term needs to begiven a sex assignment, return to the first menu that appearsunder the Describe option and choose the Sex option toassign a sex marking to this kin term.  The Save option willneed to be used if the added kin term is to be made partof the archive file for the terminology.</P><P>After the term has been selected in the kin termmap or typed in, you will be asked to confirm yourselection.</P></BODY></HTML>
