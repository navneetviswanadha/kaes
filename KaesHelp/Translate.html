<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Translate</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Translate</H1><P>The graph showing the node and the immediately adjacentnodes can be displayed in one of two ways.  First, it may bedisplayed using the algebraic element symbols and their productsas labels for the nodes in the graph.  Second, the algebraicelements can be translated into their kin term equivalent and thekin terms used to label the nodes in the graph.  The first isuseful for seeing the kinds of products that have been constructedin the algebraic structure, and the second is useful for seeingif the algebraic structure makes sense when seen from theperspective of kin terms.#L0000</P><P>The translation is carried out by first identifying an equivalencebetween primary kin terms (atoms) and the generating algebraicelements.  Second, once this equivalence has been made, an algebraic productis translated into a kin term by tracing in the kin term map thethe sequence of arrows that corresponds to the product of generatingelements in the algebraic product.  The algebraic product is thentranslated into the kin term found in the kin term map by thistracing process.#L0000</P><P>The KAES program will attempt to construct the equivalencebetween primary kin terms and generating elements.  The equivalencethat is constructed by the KAES program will be displayed and itmay be accepted or rejected by the user.</P></BODY></HTML>
