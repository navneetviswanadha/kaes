<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Generation Limit</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Generation Limit</H1><P>In some terminologies, such as the Shipibo terminology, there isan asymmetry between the number of ascending "generations" with distinctkin terms, versus the number of descending "generations" with distinctkin terms.  For the Shipibo terminology, Papa ("Father") of Papaisi ("Grandfather") = Papaisi-shoko ("Great Grandfather") but Bake ("Child)of Baba ("GrandChild) = Baba.  The symmetry can be preserved if Babais glossed as "GrandChild" or "GreatGrandChild;" that is, the "missing"node is kept in the structure and labeled with the kin term, Baba.  Alternatively, the "extra" descending "generation" in thealgebraic structure can be suppressed, thereby breaking the symmetry.  </P><P>The KAES program has determined that this asymmetry exists inthe terminology in question.  The suggested options will open a graph window that displays the problem and then offer a solution.</P></BODY></HTML>
