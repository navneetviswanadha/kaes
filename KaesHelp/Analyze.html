Ultimately thereshould be isomorphism between this graph and the kin term map. The COMPARE option is used to determine whether or not there isisomorphism between the two structures.  This differs from theIsomorphism option that can be activated under the Constructoption.  The Isomorphism option under the Construct option isused as part of the algebraic construction.</P></BODY></HTML>
