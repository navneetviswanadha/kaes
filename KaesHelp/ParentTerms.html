<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Parent Terms</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Parent Terms</H1><P>The KAES program has found that different types of arrows(differing in terms of color or in terms of light versus dark versionsof the same color) have been used to map the focal term of thekin term map to each of the two parent terms.  The use of twotypes of arrows suggests that the arrows are implicitly sexmarked by virtue of the arrow only showing a mapping from thefocal term to a single sex marked kin term.</P><P>This constrasts, for example, with the American KinshipTerminology where the kin term map uses a single arrow type tomap from the focal term, Self, to the two parent terms, Motherand Father.</P></BODY></HTML>
