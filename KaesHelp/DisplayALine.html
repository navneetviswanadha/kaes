The graph is aportion of the complete graph for thealgebraic structure or for the kin term map, depending on thetype of table selected.  When both an algebraic structure and akin term map have previously been drawn on the screen and thealgebraic structure is displayed using kin term equivalents ofalgebraic terms, both the algebraic structure graph and the kinterm map will be shown.  </P><P>After a line has been displayed, to display another lineclick on the Display option andthen the desired line.  Alternatively, click on the Return optionand then re-select the Display option.
