Whether or not this stepwill be carried out at this point in the model construction dependsupon the current kin term map.  If the active kin term map onlyhas kin terms of a single sex (including terms without sex marking),then the KAES program will inform you that no action needs to betaken at this point.  Otherwise, the KAES program will indicatethat assignment of sex to algebraic elements will be now beundertaken.</P><P>There are two ways that algebraic elements can be assignedsex marking.  The first method involves bifurcating elementscurrently in the algebra into pairs of elements, one of whichwill be given the female sex and the other of which will begiven the male sex.  This procedures is used in the AmericanKinship terminology, for example. First, algebraic elements arebifurcated into sex marked elements based on a Rule that indicateswhich kin terms are sex marked.  For the AKT, therule states that when the product of a Spouse term with a kin termyields a kin term, or the term in question is the reciprocal of sucha term, then the term will be bifurcated into sex marked elements. Inthe AKT the generating terms Parent, Child  and Spouse satisfy thisrule and so the algebraic elements, corresponding to these kin terms,e.g, P, C and Sp, are bifurcated into a pair of sex markedelements.  Thus P might be bifurcated into M and F, with M mappedto the kin term Mother and F mapped to the kin term Father, Cinto D and S with D mapped to the kin term Daughter and S mappedto the kin term Son, and Sp into W and H with W mapped to Wife andH mapped to Husband.  Second, based on this information the KAES programthen determines all the other algebraic elements that should bebifurcated into a pair of sex marked elements.  A graph can then bedrawn that shows the effect of applying the sex marking rule to thealgebra.</P><P>It should be noted that the KAES program does not actuallyneed to know that the algebraic element, P, for example, correspondsto the kin term Parent.  Instead, a strictly structural property isbeing used.  Since P is a generating element for the algebra andthe equation SpP = P holds in the algebra, then the rule applies tothe element P and the node represented by the element P is bifurcatedinto a pair of nodes and two new symbols (e.g., M and F) are enteredby the user at the request of the KAES program that will serve aslabels for these two new nodes.  The same kind of structural argumentis used for the elements C and Sp in the AKT.</P><P>Rules other than the AKT rule are also implemented in theKAES program, such as a rule that bifurcates all elements into a pairof sex marked elements.</P><P>The second manner in which elements become sex marked isthrough constructing an isomorphic copy of the current algebra andtreating the current algebra as having elements with one sex and theisomorphic copy as an algebra having elements with the other sex.  Afterthe isomorphic copy is constructed, the two algebras are joined togetherin the manner similar to the the method of constructing reciprocalelements based on making an isomorphic copy of the current algebra.  Theprocedure forms the smallest algebra which contains the current algebraand its isomorphic copy as subalgebras along with equations that indicatethe consequence of taking products of elements, one from the currentalgebra and the other from the isomorphic copy.</P><P>The first method, of bifurcating elements, is the likelymethod to follow when the generating terms in the kin term map arenot sex marked.  The second method, of constructing an isomorphiccopy, is likely to be used when the generating terms in the kinterm map are already sex marked.</P></BODY></HTML>
