<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>"Child" Sex Marked</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>"Child" Sex Marked</H1><P>The algebraic structure has elements, call them D and S, that shouldcorrespond to sex marked kin terms that can be glossed "Daughter" and "Son," respectively in the kinship terminology in question.  But the terminology has a single, non-sex marked kin term that can be glossed "Child.".  The KAES program has identified that the elements D and S are sex marked in the algebraic tructure, but "Child" is not sex marked in the kin term map, and further,neither products of D and S (such as S o S or D o s) are sex marked in the algebraic structure, nor are products of "Child" sex marked in the kin term map.  The single deviance between the sex marking of D and S and the lack of sex marking of "Child" suggests that the elements D and S should be combined toform a single element, <D, S>, without the sex marking that would otherwise beimplied. </P><P>The Shipibo terminology is an example of this property.  The kinterm,Bake, which may be glossed "Child," is not sex marked, yet in the algebraicconstruction their are elements, calld them D and S, that are initially sex marked and would, therefore, be expected to correspond to terms that can beglossed "Dauther" and "Son," respectively.  For the Shipibo terminology, the combining of the algebraic elements D and S leads to an algebraic structure thatis isomorphic with the kinterm map.  In addition, their is also a correspondancein the Shipibo terminology between the fact that there are terms occasionally used by the Shipibo for one's children that can be glossed "Daughter" and "Son" and thealgebraic form, <D, S>, which still contains the sex marked elements, D and S.  Thatis, it appears that while normally the Shipibo make the correspondance,Bake <--> <D, S> and so use the term Bake to refer to genealogical son or genealogical daughter, the Shipibo occasionally activated the embedded D and Selements and then refer to genealogical son and genealogical daughter by termscorresponding to D and S, respectively. </P></BODY></HTML>
