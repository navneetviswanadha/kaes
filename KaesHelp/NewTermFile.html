<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>New Term File</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>New Term File</H1><P>Do not replace the kin term file when adding more kin termsto the kin term file.  Replace the kin term file only if a newset of kin terms is to be entered from the keyboard.  Note thatonly the scratch file is replaced, not the archive file.  If thearchive file is to be replaced as well, then use the Save optionunder the Files option to save the new scratch file using the samefilename.</P></BODY></HTML>
