The row above thehorizontal line is the list of generating elements for the algebra.  Ifthere is not enough space for all of the generating elements to bedisplayed simultaneously on the screen, use the Right option at in thebottom window to shift the table one columen to the right.  Thecolumn to the left of the vertical line lists all elements in thealgebra.  At the intersection of this row and column is the symbol,"o", that denotes the binary product for the algebra.  The table showsthe result of taking the product of a generating element with analgebraic element, e.g., if K is the symbol in the row above thehorizontal line, L is the symbol in the vertical column to the left ofthe vertical line and M is the symbol in the intersection of theassociated column and row for these two symbols, then K o L = M.</P></BODY></HTML>
