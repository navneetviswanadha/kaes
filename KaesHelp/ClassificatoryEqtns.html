<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Classificatory Eqtns.</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Classificatory Eqtns.</H1><P>Some terminologies, such as the Trobriand Terminology, havekin terms that can be glossed "Older Brother," "Older Sister," etc.where these kin terms are also generating elements.  In such cases, thegenealogy algorithm introduces corresponding primary kin types; e.g.,b+ is the kin type corresponding to "Older Brother."  When there areclassificatory kin term equations such as "Older Brother" ofFather = Father, it may be useful to simplify the list of kin typeproducts by introducing a parallel equation at the level of kin types;e.g., fb+ = f.</P></BODY></HTML>
