In the AKT, you properly usethe kin term, Grandfather, for someone that is called Father by theperson you call Mother.  Thus, Father of Mother = Grandfather, orsymbolically, F o M = G, where F stands for Father, o stands forthe 'of' operation on kin terms, M stands for Mother and G standsfor Grandfather.</P></BODY></HTML>
