<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Sibling Arrow</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Sibling Arrow</H1><P>The Kinterm Map suggests that the term in question is asibling term such as Tuwa ("Older Brother" --  male ego, or"Older Sister" -- female ego) in the Trobriand Terminology.  Fora sibling term the equation, "Sibling Term" of "Sibling Term"= "Sibling Term;" (e.g., the equation, Tuwa of Tuwa = Tuwaor "Older Brother" of "Older Brother" = "Older Brother" for thethe Trobriand Terminology), is valid.  This suggests that if thesymbol, S, is added to the algebraic structure and S is to correspondto the sibling term, then the equation, SS = S, should also be addedto the algebraic structure.</P></BODY></HTML>
