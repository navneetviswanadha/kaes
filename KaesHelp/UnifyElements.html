The reasonfor so doing arises from the fact that for some terminologies theassociative property for products should not apply when, forexample, making a more extensive algebra through the algebraisomorphism property.  </P><P>If the associative property holds, then equations such asX(YZ) = (XY)Z would be valid.  Unification allows the product YZto be treated as an atomic element, hence after unificationrewriting X(YZ) as (XY)Z is not possible and so any equation thatwould reduce the product XY will not apply to the product X(YZ).</P><P>Several different ways to implement unification areavailable.</P><H3>XY = FOCAL ELEMENT</H3><P>For the atomic elements X and Y only, unify XY if theequation XY = Focal Element is true.</P><H3>XY = YX = FOCAL ELEMENT</H3><P>For the elements X and Y only, unify YX if XY = focalelement is true and YX = XY (the communicative property forproducts).</P><H3>UV = FOCAL ELEMENT</H3><P>For any U and V, if UV = focal element then unify UV.</P><H3>XY = W</H3><P>Unify any product, XY.</P><H3>NO UNIFICATION</H3><P>Do not unify any products; return to previous menu.
