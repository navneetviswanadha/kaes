The problem is as follows.</P><P>Some terminologies make a distinction between kin termsused by a female ego versus kin terms used by a male ego, such asterminologies where male and female egos use terms that can beglossed "Same Sex Sibling" and "Opposite Sex Sibling."  For such aterminology, a male ego would use the term "Same Sex Sibling" for amale alter whereas a female ego would use the same term for a femalealter.  Sometimes it is also the case that the kin term structurecan then be bifurcated into a male term side and a female term side.  TheShipibo Terminology is such an example.</P><P>For a terminology that makes this bifurcation, the term glossedas "Father of Son of Mother of Wife" is on the male term side (since theterm would be used by a male ego), whereas the term glossed as "Father ofHusband" (as well as the term glossed as "Father of Daughter ofMother of Husband") would be on the female side (since the latter termwould be used by a female ego).  The problem of equating a termon the male side with a term on the female side is removed if whatare otherwise sex-marked "-in-law" terms (i.e., the terms glossedas "Father of Husband," "Mother of Husband," "Father of Wife," and"Mother of Wife") are equated, in pairs, so as to remove their sexdistinctions.  This may be done via the following pair of equations:</P><H3>Mother of Husband = Father of Husband</H3>#L000012and<H3>Father of Wife = Mother of Wife.</H3><P>These two equations can be entered via the Add Equationsoption.  After entering the equations, use the algebraconstruction program to determine how thestructure changes after these equations have been added to thealgebra.  Note that only the first of these two equations needs tobe entered as the second is the reciprocal equation for the firstequation and so the KAES program will automatically query the useras to whether or not the second equation should be entered as well.</P><P>The Shipibo Terminology is an example of a terminologythat uses these equations to eliminate what otherwise is aninconsistency with the bifurcation of the kin term structure intomale side versus female side terms.</P></BODY></HTML>
