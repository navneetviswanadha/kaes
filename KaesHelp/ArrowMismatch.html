<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Arrow Mismatch</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Arrow Mismatch</H1><P>For a kin term with an equivalent term, some of thearrows are reflexive and map a term back ontoitself.  This term, with its equivalent term, is not sexmarked.  After making the equivalent term a distinct kinterm, the original term and the new term now have sexmarkings.</P><P>The relexive arrows correspond to kin terms thatalso have sex markings, so these arrows need to terminateeither at a kin term that does not have a sex marking orat a kin term with the same sex marking as the termassociated with the arrow.</P><P>Some of these reflexive arrows are now inconsistentbetween the sex of the associated kin term and thekin term to which they point.  The KAES program hasidentified the terms where there is a mismatch between thesex of the kin term associated with the reflexive arrow andthe kin term to which the arrow points.  Two correctionswill be suggested.  First, these reflexive arrows should bebe added to the new kin term which has a sex markingthat matches the sex marking of the kin terms associatedwith the arrows.  Second, these reflexive arrows should beremoved from the kin term they no longer match interms of sex marking.</P><P>Note that no structural change is being suggested bythis procedure other than the bifurcation of the kin termwith its equivalent term into two distinct kin terms.  Foreach of the two parts of the original kin term, the arrowsin question already existed, implicitly or explicitly.  Thebifurcation has led to change in sex marking of the kinterms and the arrow need to be consistent with that sexmarking.</P></BODY></HTML>
