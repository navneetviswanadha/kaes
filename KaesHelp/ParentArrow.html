<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Parent Arrow</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Parent Arrow</H1><P>The Kinterm Map suggests that one of the kin terms inquestion is a parent term (e.g., Tama ("Father") or Ina ("Mother")in the Trobriand Terminology) and the other kin term is a siblingterm (e.g., Tuwa ("Older Brother" == male ego, or "Older Sister"-- female ego) in the Trobriand Terminology).  If the equation,"Parent Term" of "Sibling Term" = "Parent Term" (e.g., Tama of Tuwa= Tama in the Trobriand Terminology) is valid in the Kinterm Map,then if the symbols, P and S, in the algebraic structure correspondto the parent term and sibling term, respectively, the equation, PS = P,should be added to the algebraic terminology.</P></BODY></HTML>
