<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>No Arrows</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>No Arrows</H1><P>There are no arrows going from any kin term in the kin termmap to the listed kin terms.  This implies that the listed kin termscannot be reached via a kin term product, which means that the mapis incompeletely (or incorrectly) drawn, otherwise the listed kinterms would have to be atomic terms.  If they are not candidatesfor atomic terms, then either the kin term map needs correction orthese terms should not appear in the kin term map as it iscurrently drawn.  Correction of this problem might involve addingarrows going from some of the kin terms in the kin term map to thelisted kin terms, or it might involve adding kin terms and arrows tothe kin term map, or it might require removing some or all of thelisted kin terms from the kin term map.  In the latter case, the KAESprogram will ask, for each of the listed terms, if it should beremoved from the kin term map.  If the reply is "OK" then the KAESprogram will erase the kin term from the map along with all arrowsfrom the pair of specified terms.  After replying to the queries, usethe "Replace" option if the modified kin term map should now becomethe kin term map to be used in further analysis.  The Save As optionshould be used if this modified kin term map is to be saved as a file.</P><P>Use the "Cancel" option if the kin term and the arrows fromthe kin term should not be changed.</P></BODY></HTML>
