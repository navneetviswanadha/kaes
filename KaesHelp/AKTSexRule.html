<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>AKT Sex Rule</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>AKT Sex Rule</H1><P>Select "Yes" to use the AKT Sex Rule to determine which elementsshould be bifurcated into a pair of sex marked elements.  The AKT SexRule bifurcates a term into a pair of sex marked terms according tothe following criteria, where Sp is the Spouse element in thealgebraic structure.  (1) Bifurcate an algebraic element, X, ifSp o X is an algebraic element.  (2) Bifurcate an algebraic element,X, if X' is the reciprocal element for the element X and Sp o X' is akin term.  (3) Otherwise, do not bifurcate an algebraic element.</P><P>The effect of the rule is to bifurcate elements based on whetheror not taking products with spouse elements yields an element.  Thus, inthe American Kinship Terminology, the rule would imply that Cousin shouldnot be marked with a sex marking since Spouse of Cousin is not a kin termunder standard usage of the American Kinship Terminology.  Bifurcationaccording to this rule relates to a division of the term Spouse intothe pair of terms, Husband and Wife.  If Spouse of K  = K, where K isa non-=sex marked term such as Parent in the AKT, then the bifurcaitonof Spouse into Husband and Wife would run entail that Husband of K orWife of K would be consistent with the sex marking of Husband and Wifeonly if K is first bifurcated into Kf and Km (female marked and malemarked kin terms, respectively), yielding products such as Husband ofKf = Km, etc.  In the AKT, the sex marking that needs to be introducedfor other terms once Spouse is bifurcated into Husband and Wife isextended only to the reciprocal terms, so that Child is bifurcated intoSon and Daughter.  In other terminologies, there may be furtherextension of the sex marking of kin terms.</P></BODY></HTML>
