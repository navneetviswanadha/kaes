<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Suggested Terms</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Suggested Terms</H1><P>To construct a product table from the Kin Term Map, kinterms that will be used to trace to all other terms must beidentified.  Normally these will be terms that can be reacheddirectly from the focal term for the terminology.  The KAESprogram determines what these terms would be and they aredisplayed in the left half of the right window.  If the suggestedterm is to be accepted, select the Next option in the window atthe bottom of the screen.  The suggested kin term will be copiedto the right column of the display.  If the suggested term shouldnot be used, either select an alternative term from the list ofkin terms in the window at the bottom of the screen, or enter thekin term from the keyboard.</P></BODY></HTML>
