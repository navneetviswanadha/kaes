<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Sib Lineage</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Sib Lineage</H1><P>In terminologies with sex marked terms that can be glossed "Son"and "Daughter," it is consistent to use different sex markings for kinterm products such as "Son" of "Sibling" or "Daughter" of "Sibling."  Interminologies such as the Shipibo terminology where there is only anon-sex marked term, Bake, that can be glossed as "Child," sex markingof products such as Bake of "Sibling" would not arise from the sex marking of the term, Bake.  In this case thesex marking of "Child" of "Sibling" need not arise, and so a kind oflocal "lineage structure" would arise whereby there would be non-sex marked kin terms for the kin term products, "Child" of "Brother" and"Child" of "Sister."  The Shipibo terminology is such an example.</P><P>The KAES program has identified that there is a non-sex markedelement that likely corresponds to the non-sex marked term in the terminology whose gloss would be "Child."  Use the suggested options to display a graph window showing the portion of the algebraic structurein question and to activate an option that will suppress what otherwisewould be sex marking of the algebraic products in question.</P></BODY></HTML>
