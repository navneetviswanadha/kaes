<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Scratch Files</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Scratch Files</H1><P>The KAES program writes a variety of temporary filesas it proceeds. When exiting the KAES program these temporaryfiles are erased.  Some of the temporary files are created whenthere is insufficient RAM memory for the screen graphics.  In thiscase it is useful to make reading and writing to the temporary filesas quick as possible, hence the suggestion of using a RAM drivefor the temporary files.</P></BODY></HTML>
