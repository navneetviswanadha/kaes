<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>No Identity Element</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>No Identity Element</H1><P>If the focal term of the kin term map is sex marked andthere are other terms in the kin term map with the opposite sexmarking, most likely the algebra that models the kin term mapwill not contain an identity element.  This observation followsfrom the construction process which makes use of isomorphic copiesof an algebra.  That the kin term map has a focal term of one sexand kin terms of the other sex suggests that the algebraicconstruction could likely begin by modeling a reduced kin map structurein which only elements of one sex appear.  The elements for theother sex would then be obtained in the construction process by makingan isomorphic copy of the reduced structure.  These two algebraswould then be "joined" together to constructa larger, more inclusive algebra in which each of the two algebarasis (isomorphically) embedded into the more inclusive algebra.  Theisomorphism mapping preserves identity elements (hence the algebra withthe elements marked by the other sex will have a sex marked identityelement). When the two algebras, each with an identity element, arejoined, it follows that the larger structure just created will haveneither of what were identity elements for the subalgebras as identityelements in the more inclusive structure.#L000010#D000010The last comment follows from the fact that an algebra witha binary product will have at most one identity element:#L000012Theorem: If I and E are both identity elements in an algebra A, thenI = E.#L000012Proof:  By virtue of I being an identity element, IE = E.  But byvirtue of E being an identity element, IE = I.  Hence I = E. QED</P><P>The theorem implies that there cannot simultaneously be amale marked identity element and a female marked identityelement.  However, in an algebra with all elements having a single sexmarking (with some possibly marked as neutral) it is possible to havean identity element that is sex marked.  This algebra may correspondto a substructure of the kin term map.  The Shipibo Terminologyis such an example.</P><P>Before continuing with the construction of an algebra thatwill model the kin term map, you may first want to subdivide the kin termmap into either a male marked or a female marked substructure and beginthe modelling process with either the male marked or the female markedsubstructure.  If, however, the analysis should begin with the kin termmap containing both a sex marked focal term and kin terms marked withthe other sex, then you should not enter an identity element whenqueried about identity elements for the algebraic structure.</P></BODY></HTML>
