Move the arrow to the grid location where the kin termshould be placed and press the left mouse button to print the kinterm at that location.  All kin terms are automatically centeredon the grid node nearest to the pointer when the left mousebutton was pressed.</P><P>When a kin term is placed in the map it is marked with anasterisk in the list of kin terms and cannot be used again, withthe exception of the "Etc" kin term.  The "Etc" kin term may beused just like any other kin term and is used to indicate thatthe kin term map continues in the same manner with the type ofarrow that links a kin term to it.  For example, if a bluearrow is used in the American Kinship Terminology to connect Selfto Parent, then to connect Parent to Grandparent and lastly theblue arrow is used to connect Grandparent to Etc, the KAESprogram will assume that Etc stands for the unending sequence,Grandparent to GreatGrandParent to GreatGreatGrandParent, etc.  </P><P>Each time the "Etc" term is used in the map either anumber or a letter is automatically appended to make it a uniquekin term.  The "Etc" terms can be given sex labels as neededusing the Sex of Terms option in the previous menu.</P></BODY></HTML>
