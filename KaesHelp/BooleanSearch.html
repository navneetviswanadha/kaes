<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Boolean Search</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Boolean Search</H1><P>A Boolean constraint may be constructed by clicking onthe items listed in the menu.  As the constraint is constructedit is displayed in the right window.  Left parentheses areautomatically added to balance right parentheses when rightparentheses are entered.  A "left to right" construction is used,so this requires that the Boolean constraint be written in thisform.  For example, it is necessary to enter "((female and 'uparrow') or neutral)" rather than the logically equivalentstatement, "(neutral or (female and 'up arrow'))".  Note that theconstraint is based on the sex of the term and kind of arrows, aswell as the Boolean operators, "and," "or," and "not."  Thisallows you to ask for terms of just one sex to be displayed, forexample.  After the constraint is constructed you are asked toconfirm it before the portion of the kin term map satisfying theconstraint is displayed.</P></BODY></HTML>
