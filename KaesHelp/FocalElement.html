<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Focal Element</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Focal Element</H1>#d000012If an algebra has an identity element, I, then I is the focalelement for the algebra.  Otherwise an element, E, that is(1) nilpotent (i.e., EE = E) and (2) if X is another element in thealgebra then either XE = X or there is an element, Y, in the algebrawith YX = E.  Note that if I is an identity element, then I is nilpotentsince II = I and for any element, X, in the algebra, XI = X, hence thefirst part of condition (2) is always satisfied.</BODY></HTML>
