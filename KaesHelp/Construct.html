<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Construct</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Construct</H1><P>The options in this menu implement several structuralfeatures used in constructing a kinship terminology algebra.  Thefirst step is to generate an initial algebra.  After the initialalgebra is generated the structure may be expanded by using theisomorphism option to build a new algebra with the initialalgebra and an isomorphic copy of it as subalgebras.  Additionalalgebraic elements can be added and verification made as towhether or not elements satisfy the algebraic criterion ofreciprocity.  Additional equations not otherwise entered duringthe construction process can also be added.</P><H3>GENERATE ALGEBRA</H3><P>If no algebra has yet been generated, select this option.</P><H3>ISOMORPHIC COPY</H3><P>This option is used to make an isomorphic copy of thecurrent algebra.  After defining the isomorphic copy, but beforegenerating the new algebra which will have the original algebraand the isomorphic copy as subalgebras, the relationship betweenthe original algebra and the isomorphic copy may be seen by usingthe Graph option to draw the current algebra and its isomorphiccopy.</P><H3>ADD ELEMENT</H3><P>Select this option if an element needs to be added to thecurrent algebra.  For example, it might be necessary to add anelement that will be the reciprocal of an element in the algebra.</P><H3>RECIPROCAL ELEMENTS</H3><P>Corresponding to the property of kin term reciprocity isthe algebraic property of reciprocal elements for an algebra. Selection of this option activates the algebraic definitioncorresponding to the idea of kin term reciprocity.  The KAESprogram examines each element in the algebra to determine if itcurrently has a reciprocal element.  If not, the KAES programwill suggest a reciprocal element if possible and an equationwhich would make the suggestion a reciprocal element for theelement in question.</P><H3>ADD EQUATIONS</H3><P>Select this option if an equation needs to be added tothe current algebra.</P><H3>BIFURCATE ELEMENTS</H3><P>In some terminologies it is useful to begin withalgebraic elements that are not sex marked and only later in theconstruction to bifurcate them into sex marked elements.  Or, anaffinal/ consanguineal distinction might not be made early on andlater in the construction the distinction should be included. This option allows for an algebraic element to be replaced by apair of elements.  The KAES program automatically constructs theimplied equations that arise from the bifurcation.</P><H3>MODIFY STRUCTURE</H3><P>Some terminologies require that certain elements bemodified.  Two options are available. (1) Equivalent Elements. This option allows certain pairs of algebraic elements to becollapsed together and treated as a single element. (2)Generation Depth.  Some terminologies restrict kin term tracingasymmetrically between ancestral terms and descendant terms. This option allows one direction to be restricted but withoutrequiring the other, reciprocal, direction to be restricted.</P><H3>FORMAL ALGEBRA</H3><P>Use this option to write the algebra in its most currentstate to the window on the left without leaving this stage of theanalysis.</P><H3>GRAPH</H3><P>Use this option to draw the graph of the algebra withoutleaving this stage of the analysis.  After an isomorphic algebrahas been defined but before the new algebra has been constructed,the graph will consist of two parts: the original algebra and theisomorphic algebra.</P></BODY></HTML>
