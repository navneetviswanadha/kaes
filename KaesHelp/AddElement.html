<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Add Element</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Add Element</H1><P>Use this option to add an atomic element to the algebra.Three types of atomic elements may be added: (1) an identityelement, (2) a spouse element and (3) a generating element.</P><H3>IDENTITY ELEMENT</H3><P>An identity element, call it I, has the property that ifE is an element in the algebra then IE = E = EI and II = I. Select this option to add an identity element if the algebracurrently does not have one.  The equations making the addedelement an identity element will be added automatically.</P><H3>SPOUSE ELEMENT</H3><P>A spouse element, call it S, will have the property thatSS = I (where I is either the identity element or the focalelement of the algebra) if it is not sex marked (e.g., spouse inthe American Kinship Terminology).  If it is sex marked thenusually there will be two spouse elements, one for each sex. Call them W and H.  In this case WH = I = HW and WW = 0 = HH.  Inaddition, there will likely be a generating element, call it P,with the property that SP = P if P is not sex marked.  Otherwise,there are likely generating elements, call them M and F, with theproperty that HM = F and WF = M.  The KAES program will query asto which of these several possibilities is applicable.</P><P>When a spouse element is entered, the KAES program willquery you automatically regarding the algebraic properties thatdefine an element to be a spouse element.</P><H3>GENERATING ELEMENT</H3><P>Usually generating elements are entered when the algebrais initially constructed or when an isomorphic algebra isconstructed. Other generating element(s) can be entered usingthis option.  The KAES program constructs any equations thatpertain to this new element by virtue of it being a generatingelement.  Properties such as reciprocity are also examined and ifnot satisfied, the KAES program will query you to see if the newgenerating element should have a reciprocal.</P></BODY></HTML>
