<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Query</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Query</H1><P>We want to know the kin term that ego would properly useto refer to alter2, based on what we know about the kin term egouses for alter1 and the kin term alter1 uses for alter2.  Wecan think of thissituation as involving three people, ego, alter1 and alter2.Ego refers to alter1 and says "Alter1 is my Mother."  Next, alter1refers to alter2 and says "Alter2 is my Father."  We want to knowfrom you, as an informant about the AKT, what kin term ego wouldproperly use to refer to alter2.  This could be re-phrased via thequestion: "If I call someone Mother, and that person calls someoneelse Father, what is the kin term I would use for that thirdperson?"  More abstractly, what is the solution to the query"A Father of a Mother is a ____"?  Symbolically, we want to knowthe right hand side of the equation, Father of Mother = _______.From your perspective as a native user of the AKT, type in the kinterm that should be used on the right hand side of this equation andthen press the <Enter> key.</P></BODY></HTML>
