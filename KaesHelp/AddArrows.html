<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Add Arrows</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Add Arrows</H1><P>When arrows are added to the kin term map, a singlearrow is used regardless of whether or not it begins or endsat a term or at its equivalent term.  This corresponds to theKAES property that a term and its equivalent term actuallyrepresent a single kin term.  The equivalent term is used forclarity in the kin term map.  When the equivalent term ismade into a distinct term in its own right, arrows that wereonly drawn to or from a term now need to be added to thenode represented by the symbol that replaces the equivalentterm symbol, and conversely.  The KAES program will do thisautomatically if the Yes option is selected.</P></BODY></HTML>
