<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Mnemonic Elements</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Mnemonic Elements</H1><P>A diagram will be displayed that shows the way in whichalgebraic products that can be glossed as "-in-law" terms whengiven their kin term translation are structurally related.  Choice(A) will use the algebraic symbols used to constructthe algebraic structure in the diagram.  Choice (B) uses a glossfor the kin term translation of the algebraic elements in thediagram.  For example, if the algebraic elements F and W have beenused and will have translation as kin terms K and L, withthe kin terms K having English gloss as "Fa(ther)" and L havingEnglish gloss as "Wi(fe)," the the diagram can be drawn either usingalgebraic element products (such as FW) to label nodes in thediagram (choice (A)), or using the English glosses (e.g., FaWiinstead of FW) (choice (B)).</P><P>The advantage of choice (A) is that the relationshipbetween the labeling of nodes and equations is immediate; theadvantage of choice (B) is that the relationship of the nodes tokin terms may be more apparent.</P><P>Note: A product written as FW is ashortened version of the algebraic notation, F o W, and thelatter has kin term translation as the kin term that resultswhen the binary product "of" is used for the correspondingkin terms; that is, FW has translation as the kin term thatcorresponds to the kin term product, "Father" of "Wife," orsymbolically,</P><P> FW = F o W <----> "Fa(ther)" of "Wi(fe)" = "Fa" of"Wi" = FaWi.</P></BODY></HTML>
