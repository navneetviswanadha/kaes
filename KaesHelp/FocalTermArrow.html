<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Focal Term Arrow</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Focal Term Arrow</H1><P>When the kin term map does not have an identity term, productsof kin terms with the focal term must be identified in the kin termmap.  As indicated in the "pop-up" window, there is a special arrowthat is used only for products with the focal term when the focal termis not an identity term.  The KAES program has indicated thatproducts with the focal term have not yet been identified in the kinterm map.  Return to the Main Menu, select the Describe option, andthen select the Construct Kinterm Map option.  Select the specialarrow (it is the fifth arrow in the list of arrows) that will beused for showing the result of taking products with the focalterms.  For each term in the kin term map, including the focalterm, draw an arrow from the term to the kin term that is theresult of taking the product of the initial term with the focalterm.  Next, redo the current step.</P></BODY></HTML>
