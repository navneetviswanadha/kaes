<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Reciprocal Elements</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Reciprocal Elements</H1><P>The next step in the algebraic construction process involvesestablishing reciprocal elements for the generating elements.  Thekin term concept of reciprocal terms, namely that if ego refers toalter by the kin term, K, and alter refers to ego by the kin termL, then K and L are reciprocal kin terms, has been implemented inthe KAES program for algebras by a structural definition.  Thekin term notion of reciprocals does not have a direct translationinto the language of algebras and instead a structural relationshipbetween reciprocal terms must be used.  The idea of a reciprocalkin term is similar to that of an inverse element for an algebra withan identity element.  For an algebra with an identity element I, thealgebraic element y is an inverse for the algebraic element x ifxy = I = yx.  This condition is too strong for kinhip terminologiesas it would require, for example, that Child of Parent = Self inthe American Kinship terminology.  This condition can be weakenedby noting that if xy = I = yx then xyx = x and yxy = y.  Thelatter pair of equations are used to define a semigroupinverse.</P><P>For a semigroup, S, an element y  in the semigroup is asemigroup inverse for an element x in the semigroup ifxyx = x and yxy = y, and conversely.  For the AKT, this would implythat Parent of Child of Parent = Parent and Child of Parent of Child =Child, for example, where x is replaced by Parent and y by Child.  Theseequations are valid for the consanguineal space (which excludes alterswith an affinal relationship to ego when calculating kin termproducts).  However, this condition is too strong for terminologiessuch as the Trobriand terminology and the notion of a semigroup inversecan be further weakened by noting that the equation xyx = x impliesthat xyxy = xy, hence the compound element, xy, is a nilpotentelement.  Similarly, yxy = y implies that yxyx = yx.</P><P>We use the idea of nilpotent elements to define reciprocalelements in the algebra.  If x is an element in the algebra, thenan element y in the algebra is a reciprocal of the element x ifthe compound elements xy and yx are each nilpotent elements.</P><P>The KAES program has identified that the generating elementsin the algebra at its current stage do not have inverse elements andso identification of inverse elements will be the next step.  TheKAES program will indicate how to introduce reciprocal elements intothe algebra.</P></BODY></HTML>
