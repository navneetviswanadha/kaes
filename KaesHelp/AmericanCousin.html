<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>American Cousin</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>American Cousin</H1><P>Some Americans drop the removal part of the English cousinnomenclature and only define an "Ith Cousin."  The rule for theAmerican nomenclature has two parts.  First, for descendinggenerations, the Child of Ith Cousin = (I+1)th Cousin.   Second,for each ascending generation, the index, I, also increases byone.  That is, if CCPP ("Child of Child of Parent of Parent")corresponds to 1st Cousin, then CCPPP (Child of Child of Parentof Parent of Parent) corresponds to 2nd Cousin, etc. (SeeGatewood, J. 1972.  "A case study of English-American kinshipterminology," Journal of the Steward Anthropological Society3(2):116 - 154 for a discussion of the American variant onCousin nomenclature.)</P></BODY></HTML>
