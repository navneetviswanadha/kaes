<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Correct Problem</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Correct Problem</H1><P>The KAES program has suggested why there fails to beisomorphism between the algebraic structure and the kin term map.If the problem is with the algebraic structure, then theconstruction process for the algebraic structure may need to bemodified.  The way in which it needs to be modified may not beimmediately apparent from the suggestion, in which case it mayrequire experimentation to determine how the algebraic structureshould be modified.</P><P>If the problem is with the kin term map, then the form ofthe map may need to be modified.  Use the Construct option underthe Describe option to modify the kin term map.</P><P>Several iterations of correcting the kin term map and/orthe algebraic structure may be needed before there isconvergence between the algebraic structure and the kin termmap.</P></BODY></HTML>
