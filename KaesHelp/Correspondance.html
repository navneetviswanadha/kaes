<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Correspondance</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Correspondance</H1><P>The KAES program has suggested which algebraic elements shouldcorrespond with what kin terms.  The KAES program uses matching structuralproperties of the kin term map and of the algebraic model to determinethe correspondance.</P><P>If there is a blank after an algebraicelement the KAES program could not determine teh kin term that shouldcorrespond with this algebraic element.  In such a case, either select theappropriate kin term from the menu at the bottom of the screen, orif the needed kin term is not yet part of the kin term map, use theKeyboard option to type in the needed kin term.  After the kin termhas been entered, the KAES program will continue with its identificationof kin terms and algebraic elements.</P><P>Should the list not be valid, or should you want to trya different correspondance, select Cancel.  This will close the Windowand return you to the previous menu.  Select Isomorphism again andthis time the KAES program will not make any suggestions.</P></BODY></HTML>
