<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Simplify Map</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Simplify Map</H1><P>The KAES program has identified that it may be necessary tosimplify the kin term map before identifying the generators for thealgebraic model.  Simplification is needed when the kin term mapcan be considered as a complex structure built out of simplerstructures.  Two kinds of simplication are recognized by theKAES program.  First, simplification may be made through kin termsthat occupy structurally equivalent positions in the kin termmap (that is, the pattern of arrows arriving at or leaving onenode is matched by the same pattern of arrows at the othernode, such as occurs with the terms Mother and Father in theAmerican Kinship Terminology).  Simplication is made throughcollapsing together structurally equivalent nodes.</P><P>Second, simplification may be made by restricting thekin term map to terms of a single sex (including some of theterms without sex marking) that can be reached from the focalelement by arrows whose corresponding kin term has the sexin question.  The KAES program has identified that simplficationis needed before the analysis proceeds and will make suggestionsabout how the kin term map may be simplified.</P></BODY></HTML>
