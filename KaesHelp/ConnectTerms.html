<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Connect Terms</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Connect Terms</H1><P>Select the connector for pairs of kin terms.  Theconnectors are either arrows which define paths from one term toanother or an "=" sign to indicate an affinal connection.</P><H3>ARROWS</H3><P>Select one of the four, color coded, arrows (up,down, left or right).  The fifth arrow is a special arrow usedonly when the focal term for the kin term map is not an identityterm.  The color coded arrows come in two sets:darker (default) and lighter shades of the same color.  Click onChange Arrow to change the arrow set.</P><P>Note that each of up, down, left or right represents aconceptual direction, not necessarily a physical direction onthe Kin TermMap.  For example, if going from Self to Parent in the AmericanKinship Terminology is thought of as moving "up," then one woulduse the up arrow to connect Self to Parent even if the termParent is placed physically below the kin term Self in the kinterm map.  Lighter and darker shades of the same color can beused to represent arrows in the same direction but representingterms with different sex markings.</P><P>To place an arrow (or the "=" sign) on the Kin Term Mapfirst click on the term in the map from which the arrow is to bedrawn.  A rectangle will appear around this term to identify thatit has been selected.  Next, click on the term to which an arrowis to be drawn.  Continue clicking on other terms if there are tobe arrows from the selected term to several other terms.  Lastly,either press the right mouse button or select the Return optionto deactivate the selected kin term.  </P><P>Reflexive kin terms which may not be extended further,such as Baba in the Shipibo Terminology, are so indicated byclicking again on the term.  The arrow will be drawn in acircular manner pointing from the term back to the term.</P><P>If other arrows are to be drawn they can now be selectedand entered in the same manner.  Press again on the right mousebutton or the Return option to terminate the Connect procedure. </P><H3>"=" -- Affine Connector</H3><P>The "=" (equal) sign is used to denote kin terms connected viamarriage and is placed in the Kin Term Map in the same manner asare the arrows.</P></BODY></HTML>
