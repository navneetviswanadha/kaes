The new term isdrawn near the term that is being split and may be treated in thesame manner as any other kin term.  The added term will notappear in the listing in the right window until the current levelof the program is exited and the Construct option is re-selected. Once a term has been split it cannot be split again.</P></BODY></HTML>
