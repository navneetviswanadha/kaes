<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Indefinite</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Indefinite</H1><P>For some kinship terminologies, kin term products of theform, "Parent" of "Parent" of . . . , can be extended indefinitelyand still arrive at a node labeled with a kin term, where "Parent"stands for the displayed kin term.  For example, in theAmerican Kinship Terminology, the kin term product, Parent ofParent of . . . of Parent (repeated n times, n > 2), corresponds tothe kin term, GreatGrand . . . Grand (repeated n-1 times)Parent.  Etc. terms are used in the kin term map to indicated thata sequence of arrows continues indefinitely using the same patternof arrows entering and leaving a kin term name as is true for the Etc. kin term.</P></BODY></HTML>
