<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Reflexive Focal Term</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Reflexive Focal Term</H1><P>The arrow from the focal term to itself suggests that thefocal term is a sibling term: "Sibling" of "Sibling" ="Sibling."  It is unlikely that a sibling term would be an identityelement. If a sibling term were an idendity element, then therewould be no kin term of the form "Sibling" of "Kin Term1" ="Kin Term2;" e.g., there would be no "Uncle" or "Aunt" terms inthe terminology.  If the focal term is not an identity term forthe kin term map, then do not enter an identity element whenqueried about identity elements for the algebraic structure.</P></BODY></HTML>
