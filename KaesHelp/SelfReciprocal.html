<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Self Reciprocal</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Self Reciprocal</H1><P>If F is the focal element of the algebra, a self reciprocalelement, A, is one that satisfies the equation AA = F.  For example,in the AKT the focal term is an identity element and the algebraicelement, S, that satisfies the spouse criterion (without sex marking)also satisfies the equation SS = I, hence S is self reciprocal.  Thekin term equivalent for S would be Spouse, the kin term equivalent forI would be Self, and with respect to kin term products, Spouse of Spouse= Self.</P></BODY></HTML>
