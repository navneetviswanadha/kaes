<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Algebraic Model</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Algebraic Model</H1><P>By an algebraic model is meant a set of symbols, oneor more operations that take symbol(s) from the set of symbolsas arguments and return a symbol as the output of theoperation, and equations that the operation(s) may berequired to satisfy.  For the purpose of constructing algebraicmodels for kinship terminology structures, the symbolswill be linked to kin terms, there will be a single, binaryoperation (a binary operation has two symbols as its input)and equations based upon characteristics of the kin termmap.  Usually, it is required that the operation(s) be definedfor all symbols in the set of symbols.  For example, if we letS be the set of symbols and let the special symbol "o" representa binary operation defined for all pairs of symbols from S, thenone equation we might require is that (a o b) o c =a o (b o c).  This equation is known as the Associative Lawand an algebra for which this equation is valid is sometimescalled as associative algebra.  The equation implies thatparentheses are not needed to keep track of the pairs of symbolsover which the operation, o, acts first.  Thus a o b o c is notambiguous if the algebra is associative since the associativelaw implies that doing the operation first on the pair of symbols,a and b, and then doing the operation on the result of thatoperation and the symbol c is the same as if the operation isfirst done on the pair of symbols, b and c, and then the operationis done on the symbol, a, and the result of that operationapplied to the symbols b and c.</P><P>A set of symbols, S, with a single binary operation thatis associative and defined over all pairs of symbols in S isknows as a semigroup.  Semigroups are a "natural" algebra formodeling kinship terminology structures since we can view akinship terminology as a set of symbols (the kin terms) with abinary product (the kin term product) that is associative, henceis a semigroup.</P><P>One of the primary goals of the modeling is to show thatthe structure presented graphically in the form of the kin termmap can be generated as an algebra from a small set of kinterms (atomic terms) using equations applied to all terms thatmeet the conditions of the equations.  This is a non-trivialgoal in that it one can easily construct structures that cannotbe generated in this manner.  For example, a genealogy of a set ofrelated persons would normally not have a structure that can beso generated.</P><P>The KAES program identifies the steps that most likely willneed to be executed as part of the process of identifying the atomickin terms (generating elements for the algebra) and equationsto be satisfied by the kin term product (binary operation).  "Pop-up"windows will guide the analysis in accordance with the analysis madeby the KAES program of the kin term map and an underlying theoryregarding the nature and form of kinship terminology structures.  Notall analyses will proceed using the same sequence of steps and theKAES program will determine the order in which the steps should befollowed.  No choice needs to be made in the pop-up window displaying theseveral steps that are part of an analysis.  Instead, the KAES programhighlights the next step that will be conducted after the Continueoption is selected.</P></BODY></HTML>
