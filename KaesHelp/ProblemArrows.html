This implies that the kin termcorresponding to this arrow type cannot be used to relate an egofor whom the focal term can be applied to an alter via the kinterm corresponding to the identified arrow type.  For example, supposefor the American kinship terminology a tentative kin term map is drawn inwhich the arrow type "upward and blue" does not originate at the focalkin term, Self, and futher, suppose this arrow type corresponds tothe kin term, Father.  Then if ego is located at the focal term (i.e.,ego uses Self as the kin term for her/himself) it follows that the kin termproduct, Father of Self, does not exist in this kin termmap since the Father arrow ("upward and blue") does not originate at thekin term, Self, and terminate at the kin term, Father.</P><P>Correction of this problem could involve placing an arrow of thespecified type originating at the focal term.  Alternatively it couldinvolve erasing the specified arrow type where ever it appears in thekin term map.  The KAES program will ask, for each pair of kin termslinked by the arrow in question, if the arrow should be removed forthis pair of terms.  If the reply is "Yes" then the arrow will be erasedfrom the pair of specified terms.  After replying to the queries, usethe "Replace" option if the modified kin term map should nowbecome the kin term map to be used in further analysis.  The Save Asoption should be used if this modified kin term map is to be saved as a file.</P></BODY></HTML>
