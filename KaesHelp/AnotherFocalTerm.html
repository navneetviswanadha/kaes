When a focal element, E, has been represented using theequivalent term format, so that the focal element isrepresented by the pair of symbols, E and "E", and whenthe equivalent symbol, "E", is made into a kin termin its own right, then the new kin term will have thesame structural properties as does the term, E.  Hence thenew kin term will be a focal term for the kin termmap.</P><P>Select Yes if the original focal element andthe newly formed kin term should both be focal elements for thekin term map.</P></BODY></HTML>
