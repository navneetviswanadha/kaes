<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Modify Structure</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Modify Structure</H1><P>Some terminologies require modifications of the algebraby local properties that are not globally propagated throughoutthe structure.  For example, in the Shipibo terminology there isbut a single kin term "Child" but distinction is made between"Son of Father" and "Daughter of Mother."  The "Son", "Daughter"distinction is part of the algebraically generated structure, butis then removed at a later stage without simultaneously replacingall instances of "Son" and of "Daughter" by the term, "Child."  </P><H3>EQUIVALENT ELEMENTS</H3><P>The options under Equivalent Elements allow for pairs ofelements to be made equivalent according to several criteria.</P><H3>GENERATION DEPTH</H3><P>Some terminologies are asymmetric with regard to thedistance "up" or "down" that kin terms may be traced.  Thisoption allows for asymmetry in reciprocal algebraic products.</P></BODY></HTML>
