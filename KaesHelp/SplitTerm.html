<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Split Term</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Split Term</H1><P>Split the kin term into two equivalent terms.  The two equivalentterms will be treated analytically as if they are a single term.  Theadvantage of splitting a term lies in simplifying the kin term map sothat arrows crossing over the map are not needed.  For example, in theAKT the kin term "2nd Cousin Once Removed" can be reached directlyvia the Child map either from the kin term "Great Uncle/Aunt" or the kinterm "Second Cousin."  By having two copies of the kin term "2nd CousinOnce Removed" the map can be simplified to:</P><P>G. Uncle --> 2nd C. Once Removed --> Second C. --> "2nd C. Once Removed"</P>versus a diagram with an arrow that loops back:<P>Great Uncle --> 2nd Cousin Once Removed --> Second Cousin -->2nd Cousin Once Removed.</P></BODY></HTML>
