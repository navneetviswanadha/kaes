The restricted mapis constructed by limiting the kin term map to those terms thatcan be reached by tracing from the focal term using arrowswith the same sex marking (either male or female).  Theconstruction proceeds as follows.  First, a Boolean criterionbased on the arrows to be used in the tracing is constructed bythe KAES program.  (The Boolean criterion will be displayed ina subsequent window in the KAES program.)  This restricts thekin term map to just those terms with an arrow of the specifiedtype either pointing to or from the kin term.  Second, all termsto which no arrow points are erased, since these kin termscannot be reached by tracing from the focal term with theselected arrows.  And third, any remaining terms that cannotbe reached by tracing from the focal term are erased.</P></BODY></HTML>
