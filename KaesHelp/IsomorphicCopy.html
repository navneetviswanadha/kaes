<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Isomorphic Copy</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Isomorphic Copy</H1><P>The KAES program has suggested that elements should becomesex marked through constructing an isomorphic copy of thecurrent algebra and treating the current algebra as having elementswith one sex and the isomorphic copy as an algebra having elementswith the other sex.  After the isomorphic copy is constructed, thetwo algebras are joined together in a manner similar to the methodused for constructing reciprocal elements based on making anisomorphic copy of the current algebra.  The procedure is to constructthe union of the algebra and its isomorphic copy and then add equationsas appropriate that indicatethe consequence of taking products of elements, one from the currentalgebra and the other from the isomorphic copy.</P></BODY></HTML>
