<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Correspondence</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Correspondence</H1><P>After the algebra and the kin term map have been selecteda correspondence between algebraic atoms and kin terms needs tobe set up.  The window on the right shows the algebraic elementsfor which a corresponding kin term is needed.  The KAES programautomatically enters any kin term with the same label as analgebraic element as corresponding to each other.  In addition,it will attempt to determine the appropriate correspondencebetween kin terms and algebraic elements.  If the list providedis acceptable, click on End; otherwise, click on Cancel.  </P><P>If Cancel was selected, then when you redo this option,you will need to enter the kin terms that correspond to thealgebraic elements.  Select the kin term from the list of kinterms at the bottom of the screen that will be the kin termcorresponding to the last algebraic element displayed with adouble headed arrow. After selecting the kin term, select theNext option to move to the next algebraic element.  Select Endwhen all elements are displayed with a corresponding algebraicterm.</P><P>The correspondence is used by the KAES program to changean algebraic element into a kin term.  The correspondence between kin terms and algebraic elements is based on this mapping ofalgebraic elements into kin terms.  The correspondence allows thealgebraic structure to be viewed either as a formal structure(expressed in terms of its symbols) or as an interpretedstructure (with the symbols interpreted as kin terms).  Thelatter helps show the whether or not the algebra has the samestructure as the kin term map when the product table for thealgebra is displayed.  </P></BODY></HTML>
