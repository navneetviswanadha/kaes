<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Unbalanced Products</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Unbalanced Products</H1><P>Kin term products of the form, X of Y and X of Y', whereY and Y' differ only by their sex marking, areoften balanced in that if, say, "Daughter" of Y yields a kin termthen "Daughter" of Y' yields a kin term, where "Daughter" is the English gloss of the kin term in question.  For example, in the American Kinship Terminology, Daughter ( = X) of Mother (= Y) is defined and Daughter of Mother = Sister.  Similarly, Daughter of Father ( = Y') is defined and Daughter of Father = Sister.  Most likely, products involving kin terms thatcan be glossed as "Mother," "Father," "Parent," "Son," "Daughter," or "Child" will have a balance using products where one of the terms inthe product only differs from the corresponding product bythe sex of these terms.  This impliesthat in the algebraic structure, if Y and Y' are algebraic elements that would correspond, say, to "Mother" and "Father," respectively, thenif the product X o Y is defined in the algebraic structure (that is,X 0 Y <> 0), then X o Y' should also be defined in the algebraicstructure.</P><P>The KAES program has determined that the algebraic structurecontains unbalanced products.  Use the suggested options to graphicallydisplay which elements are involved in the unbalanced product.  The options will also provide a solution for the unbalanced product.  Try thesolution to see if this leads to an algebraic structure that begins toconverge on the structure displayed in the kin term map.</P></BODY></HTML>
