<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Construct Kinterm Map</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Construct Kinterm Map</H1><P>The menu at the bottom of the screen provides options foruse in constructing a kin term map.  The kin terms available forthe map are listed in the window on the right and the kin termmap is constructed in the window on the left.</P><H3>LABEL</H3><P>Use this option to place a kin term in the map.  Click onthe kin term and then click on the position where the kin term isto be drawn.  </P><H3>CONNECT</H3><P>Select this option to draw arrows from one kin term toone or more kin terms.  Begin by clicking on the type of arrow tobe used for connecting a pair of kin terms.  Note that there aretwo sets of arrows, distinguished by darker versus lighterversions of the same color.  The default arrows are the darkercolored arrows.  Click on Change Arrow to change to the secondset of arrows.  </P><P>After selecting a type of arrow, click on the term fromwhich the arrow is to begin and then click on the term where thearrow is to end.  Continue clicking on terms where the arrow isto end if arrows are to be drawn from the term where the arrowsbegin to several kin terms. Click on the right button (or onRETURN) when no more arrows from the selected term are to bedrawn. </P><H3>MOVE</H3><P>Use this option to move a kin term in the map to a newlocation.  Click on the kin term to be moved and drag the termwhile holding down the left mouse button.</P><H3>SPLIT</H3><P>The split option is used to split a kin term into twoequivalent terms for mapping purposes.  The added kin term iswritten in the form, "Term", where Term is the term to be splitinto two equivalent terms.  The Split option can be used when twocopies of the same kin term are needed for better visual display. Though two terms, Term and "Term", will be displayed in the kinterm map, the two labels are treated as representing a single termin the structural analysis.</P><H3>ERASE</H3><P>The erase option can be used to erase kin terms and/or toerase arrows connecting kin terms.  Click on the term or arrow tobe erased.</P><H3>DISPLAY ICON</H3><P>The icon immediately to the right of the arrows is theDisplay Icon.  Selection of this icon will activate a window thatallows for three actions: (1) moving the position of the map onthe work space, (2) zooming in or out and (3) rotating the map.</P><H3>SCREEN ICON</H3><P>To the right of the Display Icon is the Screen Icon.Selection of this icon will expand the work space to the fullscreen, excepting the menu at the bottom.  Exiting from theConstruct menu while the work space has been expanded is notallowed.  Select the Screen Icon again to reduce the work spaceback to its initial size, then use either the Return option orthe right mouse button to exit from the Construct Menu.</P></BODY></HTML>
