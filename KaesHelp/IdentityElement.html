<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Identity Element</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Identity Element</H1><P>An identity element in an algebraic structure is anelement that does not change other elements when there is aproduct between the identity element and the other element.  Forexample, if the identity element is labeled I, and A is anyelement in the algebraic structure, then IA = I = AI.  Forkin terms, the equivalent statement would be that the kinterm product of an identity kin term with any other kin termdoes not change the later kin term.  For example, in the AKTthe kin term Self has the property that if K is a kin termthen Self of K = K of Self = K; e.g., Self of Parent = Parentof Self = Parent.  Hence an algebraic structure isomorphic tothe AKT must have an identity element.</P><P>When an element is entered as an identity element, allequations that are needed to define it as an identity elementare added automatically to the algebra.  This will be true notonly at this stage in the construction process, but at anysubsequent stage when another generating element isintroduced in the construction process.</P></BODY></HTML>
