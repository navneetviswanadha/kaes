This type ofproduct determines a colineal line of kin terms so long as eachproduct using the "Child" term results in a new kin term (or node)in the kin term map.  The colineal line starts at the nodedetermined by the product "Parent" of "Parent" of . . .  of"Parent."</P><P>The right hand side of the kin term product equationindicates that the product on the left side does not result ina new node, but maps the last node in the colineal line to thenode in the colineal line determined by the product on the righthand side of the kin term product equation.  (If the product on theright hand side does not being with the "Child" term, then themapping is to the lineal line determined by the products of theform, "Parent" of "Parent" of . . . of "Parent.")</P><P>Normally, an equation will be needed in the algebraicstructure to produce this structural property.  The KAES programdisplays the form of the equation, using as symbols in thealgebraic structure, F, N, P, S, D, and C, with these symbolsecorresponding to the atomic kin terms in the kin term map.  TheKAES progarm will query whether or not these equations shouldbe entered (and using the genertor symbols that are inputfrom the keyboard) as the construction process continues.</P></BODY></HTML>
