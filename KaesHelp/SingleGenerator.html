<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Single Generator</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Single Generator</H1><P>In an algebraic structure, each generating element willcorrespond to a distinct arrow. The fact that there is only onetype (i.e., direction and color) of arrow leading from the focal termsuggests that a single generator will be needed for constructingthe algebraic structure.   For example, for the AKT, there isa single type of arrow going from the focal term, Self, to the kin term,Parent, in the reduced structure for the AKT.  This suggests the useof a single generator, which could be labeled P for mnemonic purposes,for the algebraic structure.</P><P>Alternatively, if there are arrows from the focal term totwo kin terms and the two terms are structurally equivalent thena single generating element is needed as the construction processwill most likely begin with the reduced kin term map obtainedby replacing structurally equivalent kin terms by a single kinterm.  For example, the kin terms Father and Mother in the AKT arestructurally equivalent, and in the reduced structure for the completekin term map this pair of terms is replaced by the kin termParent.  The reduced structure can be obtained by using theReduce Structure option under the Describe option.</P><P>Other generating elements, such as a reciprocal element forthe generator, may need to be added to the algebra at a later stepin the construction process.  For example, for the AKT thereciprocal of the kin term, Parent, is the kin term, Child.  Afterthe initial algebra is constructed based on the single element, callit P, an additional element, call it C, is added to the algebraicstructure that will be the algebraic reciprocal of the algebraicelement, P.</P><P>Yet other generating elements may need to be added toincorporate properties such as affinal elements.  For example, inthe AKT an element is added, call it S, that satisfies thealgebraic criterion for a Spouse element.</P><P>The construction process is an incremental one in whichan initial structure can be elaborated upon.  Alternatively, ifprior work makes it clear that an element and its reciprocal willboth be needed in the structure, it is possible to begin withtwo generating elements, say P and C, and the program will querythe user as to which one, if either, should be the reciprocalelement.  For some structures, there will be more than onegenerating element without either element being the reciprocalof the other.  For example, for the Trobriand Terminology thegenerating elements are F ("Father") and B ("Older Brother").</P></BODY></HTML>
