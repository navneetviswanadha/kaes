<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Describe</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Describe</H1><P>This part of the program is used to input the kin terms,to make a kin term map, and to examine the map for structuralfeatures that help in constructing an algebraic structureisomorphic to the kin term map structure.</P><H3>INPUT TERMS</H3><P>Input the names of kin terms.  Kin terms can be up to 20characters in length, but because of space problems withwriting long names to the screen, shortened versions of longnames (e.g., GrGrdFa in place of GreatGrandFather) should beused.</P><H3>CHANGE TERMS</H3><P>Use this option to correct the spelling of kin terms, todelete terms from the list of kin terms, to unsplit equivalentterms into separate terms and to reassign the kin term linked toan arrow in the kin term map.</P><H3>SEX OF TERMS</H3><P>The sex marking for kin terms, if any, must be enteredmanually for each kin term.</P><H3>FOCAL TERM</H3><P>Use this option to display the focal term for the kinterm map (if any), to select a kin term as the focal term or tochange the current focal term. </P><P>The criterion used by the KAES program for defining afocal term is similar to the idea of a source in graph theory.  Akin term is a focal term if (a) no arrow points to the kin term(a source in graph theory), or (b) whenever there is an arrowpointing to the kin term there is an arrow of the same kindpointing from the kin term (to be called here a pseudo-source). For a pseudo-source, if we have the pattern, Term 1 ---> FocalTerm, then there must be a Term 2 with Focal Term --> Term 2using the same kind of arrow.  In the AKT, the term Self is afocal term since the (parent) arrow from Child to Self isbalanced by the (parent) arrow from Self to Parent and all otherarrows point from Self to kin terms.</P><H3>CONSTRUCT KIN TERM MAP</H3><P>Provides a work space for constructing a kin term map.</P><H3>DRAW KIN TERM MAP</H3><P>After a kin term map has been constructed (and savedusing the Save option under Files if it is to be used in futuresessions) it may be displayed using this option.  Severaldifferent types of displays are available.</P><H3>REDUCE STRUCTURE</H3><P>Both here and with the Display option a simpler, morebasic structure can possibly be identified.  This option allowsfor structurally equivalent terms (i.e., a pair of terms thathave the same pattern of arrows to and from each of the pair ofterms and other terms) to be identified and a new mapautomatically constructed based on the structurally equivalentterms so identified.  For example, for the American KinshipTerminology, Mother and Father are structurally equivalent andSon and Daughter are structurally equivalent in the space ofconsanguineal kin terms (these are just some of the structurallyequivalent pairs).  The former pair may be replaced by the term,Parent, and the latter pair by the term, Child (and similarly forother structurally equivalent pairs).  With these replacementsa new map will now be formed and displayed based on Parent,Child, and so on.</P></BODY></HTML>
