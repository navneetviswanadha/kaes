<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Equivalent Elements</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Equivalent Elements</H1><P>Some elements are made equivalent to each other bymeans of equations that apply globally; that is, the equationsare used to reduce all algebraic products.  For such equations,the algebraic construction program is used to determine theconsequence of including the equation in the algebraicstructure.</P><P>In other cases, some elements may be made equivalentto each other locally via equations that only apply to someelements rather than globally via equations that apply to allelements.  The nomenclature for Cousin terms in theAmerican Kinship Terminology is such an example.  Consider thedefinition for an "Ith Cousin, J Times Removed."  Ingenealogical terms, an alter who is a First Cousin Once Removedwith respect to ego is either the child of an alter who is aFirst Cousin  with respect to ego or the child of an alter who isa Great Aunt or Great Uncle with respect to ego.  In kin terms,a First Cousin Once Removed is either, Child of First Cousin, orChild of Great Aunt (Uncle).  Then, an appropriately definedrule will be use to ensure that the positions in the algebraicstructure that correspond to Child of First Cousin and Childof Great Aunt (Uncle) become equivalent to each other.  Thisrule, though, will only be applied to the algebraic nodes thatcorrespond to Cousin terms and not to all nodes in thealgebraic structure.</P><P>The nodes where the rule should be applied isdetermined as follows.  The Cousin terms in the AKT are thepositions in the kin term map that are reached from the kin termSelf by ascending at least two generations(i.e., Parent of Parent) and then descending at least two generations(i.e., Child of Child of . . . ).  If the symbols P and C areused in the algebraic structure and these correspond to Parentand Child, respectively, then the nodes in the algebraic structurecorresponding to the Cousin terms in the kin term map will beproducts of the form CC . . . CPP . . . P, where theproduct has at least two C's and at least two P's.  Thus the ruledetermining which nodes will be made equivalent (and hence willhave a single, corresponding kin term) will only be applied tothese nodes, hence it is a local and not a global rule.</P><H3>COUSIN ELEMENTS</H3><P>This option activates choices among three differentnomenclature systems for Cousin terms: (1) English nomenclature,(2) American nomenclature and (3) a simplifed nomenclature thatdoes not distinguish among kinds of Cousins.  Corresponding toeach of these choices is an equation that defines which algebraicproducts are to be treated as equivalent and thuscorrespond to the same kin term.  For example, in the Englishnomenclature for Cousins, a First Cousin Once Removed willcorrespond to both of the algebraic products, CCCPP and CCPPP,assuming the algebra has generating symbols C and P and thesecorrespond to the kin terms, Child and Parent, respectively.</P><P>After the equation is used, the structure loses thealgebraic property that the (binary) product gives rise to aunique element.  Instead, the binary product becomesone-to-many over the "cousin" portion of the algebraicstructure. For example, in the English nomenclature for Cousinterms, a kin term product such as Child ofFirst Cousin Once Removed can either be: (1)Second Cousin or (2) First Cousin Twice Removed.  Hencethe corresponding product in the algebraic structure, namelyC(CCCPP), will be one-to-many; that is, C(CCCPP) = CCCCPP (i.e.,First Cousin Twice Removed) or C(CCCPP) = CCCPPP (i.e.,Second Cousin).</P><P>The algebraic concept of a one-to-many product has itslinguistic equivalent via the concept of polysemy.  Polysemicsemantic forms are those that require a disjunctive definitionfor expressing their meaning.  Monosemic semantic forms arethose that have a single meaning or whose meaning can beexpressed using conjunctive definitions.  For example,a genealogical definition of Child is "son of ego" AND"daughter of ego."  Hence, Child is monosemic.  However,First Cousin Once Removed is "child of a first cousin" OR"child of a great aunt/uncle."  Thus, First Cousin OnceRemoved is polysemic.</P><P>The polysemic nature of the"Ith Cousin J times Removed" nomenclature for the Cousinterms, however, has generally been ignored in theliterature.  Instead, discussions have focused on thegeneralized Cousin term that is used for all of the Cousinpositions in the kin term map.  The generalized Cousin termis monosemic.</P><H3>UNBALANCED PRODUCTS</H3><P>Some algebraic structures will have some differences.</P><H3>SIB LINEAGE</H3><P>For some terminologies, "Son" and "Daughter" of "Brother"("Sister") are collapsed together onto a single kin term, "Childof Brother" ("Child of Sister").  The Shipibo terminology is oneexample where this takes place.</P><H3>SIB EQUIVALENCE</H3><P>Certain sibling elements are made equivalent.</P><H3>CHILD EQUIVALENCE</H3><P>For some terminologies, "Son" and "Daughter" algebraicelements are needed for generating the structure.  Suppose, forexample, the symbols C, c and P are used in the algebraicconstruction, where C has interpretation as the kin term "Son," cthe interpretation as the kin term "Daughter" and Pinterpretation as the kin term "Father." Then the product CP("Son of Father") may need to be kept algebraically distinct fromcP ("Daughter of Father"), even though the terminology mayactually dissolve the sex distinction between "Son" and"Daughter" and use but a single term, "Child."  In such asituation, the algebraic elements C and c need to be locallycollapsed into a single, non-sex marked element but not globallyso that products such as CP and cP retain their sex marking.</P><P>The Child Equivalence option allows (using the aboveexample where C and c are initially sex marked) for C and c tonow be treated as a single, non-sex marked symbol withoutsimultaneously forcing products such as CP and cP to lose theirsex markings and thereby each to become (if their sex markingswere dissolved), "Child of Father."  The Shipibo terminology isan example of this kind of terminology.</P><H3>"PARENT-IN-LAW"</H3><P>Under this option sex marking of "Parent-in-Law" termsis eliminated by equation the corresponding sex markedelements.  In glossed form, equations such a "Mother of Husband"= "Father of Husband" and "Father of Wife = Mother of Wife" areintroduced and used globally.  THe Shipibo terminology is anexample of a terminology where the sex marking of "Parent-in-Law"terms is eliminated in this manner.</P></BODY></HTML>
