<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Sex Marking</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Sex Marking</H1><P>The KAES program has not been able to identify thelikely procedure to use for sex marking of algebraicelements.  Two procedures are possible: Isomorphic Copy orBifurcate Elements.</P><P>The firstprocedure is used when the generating kin terms are already sexmarked and the kin term map has been reduced to kin terms ofa single sex (and possibly some terms that are not sexmarked).  In this situation the KAES program assumes that thecurrent kin term map should have sex marking based on the sexmarking of the reduced kin term map.  The elements with theopposite sex marking is constructed by making an isomorphiccopy of the algebra and then joining the original algebraic structureand the isomorphic copy together.  They are joined togetherby forming the union of the elements in these two algebras andincluding, as appropriate, equations that define products fromone algebra with elements from the other algebra.  This procedure isused with the construction of the algebraic model for theShipibo and Trobriand terminologies.</P><P>The second procedure is used when the reduced kin termmap consists only of terms that are not sex marked.  Elements inthe algebra become sex marked by introducing a rule that defineswhich elements should be bifurcated into a pair of terms(which can be though of as the reverse of collapsing togetherstructurally equivalent terms), each of which will be sexmarked.  This procedure is used when constructing the algebraicmodel for the American Kinship Terminology.</P></BODY></HTML>
