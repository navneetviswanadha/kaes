<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Iso. Comparison</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Iso. Comparison</H1><P>The algebraic structure and the kin term map arefound to be isomorphic based upon a comparison of the twostructures.  In some cases one structure is more extensivethan the other in terms of number of steps away from thefocal term displayed in the structure.  In such a case thecomparison may be ambiguous.  The KAES program will inform theuser if the isomorphic comparison has ambiguities.  If there areambiguities, they will be displayed in the next screen.</P></BODY></HTML>
