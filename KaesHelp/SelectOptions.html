<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Select Options</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Select Options</H1><P>The menu at the bottom of the screen is used to eitherselect an element from a list of elements or to enter an elementfrom the keyboard.  The window on the right is the work space andindicates what kind of element is needed.  When selectingelements, the window on the right indicates the element whichneeds a corresponding element with a two headed arrow.  When anelement is selected or entered from the keyboard the element iswritten in the right window.  Additional elements are selected orentered from the keyboard until all needed selections have beenmade.</P><P>The menu at the bottom is divided into two main parts.The part on the left will display elements from the algebra as itis currently defined. If one of these elements is to be selected,click on it with the mouse.  The right hand side of the menulists several options, with only the options that are legitimateat this stage active.</P><H3>NEXT</H3><P>Select this option to go on to the next element to beselected or entered from the keyboard.</P><H3>ERASE</H3><P>Select Erase if the currently selected element or elemententered from the keyboard is incorrect.  Erase acts on the entireword, not on individual letters.  If a previously entered elementis incorrect, it is not possible to back up to that element. Instead, Cancel and restart.</P><H3>END</H3><P>Select End when finished with either selecting orentering a element, or when done with this stage of the analysis. If more terms need to be entered from the keyboard or selected,the effect of the End option is just to define the currentelement as correct and not in need of correction. The Next optionacts in a similar way.  When no more elements are needed, the Endoption automatically closes out this menu.</P><P>Note that when entering an isomorphic element for anidentity element, it is possible to select the End option beforea selection has been made or before an entry has been made fromthe keyboard.  Doing so causes the isomorphic element to beidentical to the identity element.</P><H3>KEYBOARD</H3><P>Select this option when the element is to be entered fromthe keyboard.  The text will appear in the work space as it istyped.  If a correction is needed, use the Backspace Key to eraseincorrectly entered letters, or move the cursor to the locationin the element where a correction is to be made.  Press the Enterkey when done, or select the End option.</P><H3>CANCEL</H3><P>Use this option to cancel any entries that have been madeand to return to the previous menu.</P></BODY></HTML>
