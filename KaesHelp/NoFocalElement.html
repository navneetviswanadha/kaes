<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>No Focal Element</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>No Focal Element</H1><P>The algebraic structure does not yet have an elementthat satisfies the algebraic criterion for a focalelement.  A focal element for an algebra is an element, E, thatis either (a) an identity element for the algebra or (b) hasthe property that it is a nilpotent element (EE = E) and forany other algebraic element, X, either XE = X or there is analgebraic element Y with YX = E.  Without a focal element itis not possible to simply add another generating element alongwith appropriate equations to the algebra so as to make thenew symbol the reciprocal for an element, A, already in the algebra.</P><P>The problem that arises when trying to carry out thisprocedure is that the equation needed todefine one element as the reciprocal of another element mustuse a focal element, E, as part of the equation.  Recall thatan element Y is the reciprocal of the element X if (1) YXis nilpotent and (2) either YX = E or XY = E.  The problem ofdefining a reciprocal element via the focal element can beresolved in the following manner.</P><P>For many kin term structures the structure defined bya focal term and an atomic term is isomorphic to the structuredefined by the focal term and an atomic term.  Thus,for the American Kinship Terminology, the structure determined bythe kin terms, Self and Parent, is isomorphic to the structuredetermined by the kin terms, Self and Child.  This suggests thatin the situation where we have an algebra based on elementswithout a focal element in the algebra, we can construct whatwill eventually become the reciprocal elements by forming anisomorphic copy of the algebraic structure and then joining togetherthe original structure and the isomorphic copy.  Thus, if thecurrent algebra has generating elements X and Y, we can constructan isomorphic copy using generating elements we label x and y.  Thatis, we simply replace every instance of an X or a Y with, say, x and y,respectively.</P><P>Next we "join together" the two structures by forming thesmallest algebra that contains the two isomorphic algebras assubalgebras.  We also introduce equations as needed todefine the consequence of taking products with elements fromone subalgebra and elements from the other, isomorphic,subalgebra.  According to property (2) above, if X and x are tobe reciprocal elements the compound elements Xx or xX should eachbe a focal element.  We can ensure that this is the case in the \new algebra we are constructing by introducing the appropriateequations, including an equation(s) that makes Xx and xXnilpotent elements.</P><P>For example, the algebraic model for the TrobriandTerminology uses this procedure for introducing reciprocalelements.  Further, the needed equations arise automatically out of theproperties already introduced in the previous steps in theconstruction process.  The KAES program is now suggesting thatthis procedure should be followed as a way to introduce bothreciprocal elements and a focal element into the algebra.</P></BODY></HTML>
