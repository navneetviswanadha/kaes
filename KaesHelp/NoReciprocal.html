<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>No Reciprocal</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>No Reciprocal</H1><P>The suggestions made by the KAES program to establish areciprocal element for the newly entered generating element haveall been rejected.  Thus, no element has yet been established asa reciprocal for the newly entered generating element.  The userwill need to determine if (a) yet another generating element needs tobe introduced that will become the reciprocal element in question,or (b) if an equation other than those suggested by the KAES programshould be used to define an element as a reciprocal element to thenewly entered generating element.</P></BODY></HTML>
