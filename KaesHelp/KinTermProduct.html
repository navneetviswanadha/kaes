<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Kin Term Product</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Kin Term Product</H1><P>The definition of a kin term product does not depend uponthe genealogical relationship of ego to alter1, alter1 to alter2,or ego to alter2.  Instead, it is based on the conceptual linkagesamong kin terms that allows individuals to know the proper kin termsfrom the way the kin terms are used by one person for anotherperson without necessarily referring first to a genealogicalspace.  The kinship terminology is viewed as a conceptualstructure with its own logic and the goal of the analysis is tomake that logic observable through constructing an algebraicstructure isomorphic to the kin term structure.</P></BODY></HTML>
