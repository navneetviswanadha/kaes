<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Reduce Structure</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Reduce Structure</H1><P>The kin term map may possibly have some of its complexityreduced by replacing structurally equivalent terms by a single,covering term.  Two terms are structurally equivalent when thepattern of arrows originating or ending at one of the terms hasthe same pattern for the other term.  For example, Mother andFather are structurally equivalent terms in the American KinshipTerminology.</P><H3>DISPLAY STRUCTURALLY EQUIVALENT TERMS</H3><P>This option will identify sets of structurally equivalentterms, if any, and draw an ellipse around each set ofstructurally equivalent terms. </P><H3>LABEL STRUCTURALLY EQUIVALENT TERMS</H3><P>The sets of structurally equivalent kin terms will bedisplayed in the right window and you will be asked to provide acover term for the set of structurally equivalent terms.  Forexample, the kin terms Mother and Father are structurallyequivalent in the American Kinship Terminology and the kin term,Parent, can be used as a cover term for the set, {Mother,Father}.  For a term that is not structurally equivalent to anyother term, the cover term is automatically taken to be the kinterm.  For example, Cousin will automatically be made the coverterm for the class {Cousin} since the kin term, Cousin, is notstructurally equivalent to any other kin term.</P><P>After cover terms have been entered for all classes thekin term map based on the cover terms will be displayed.  Thisnew map may be edited in the same manner that the original kinterm map can be edited.  This new kin term map can be substitutedfor the original kin term map (and saved using the Save Asoption).</P></BODY></HTML>
