<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Second Focal Element</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Second Focal Element</H1><P>When going from one algebra to a second, isomorphicalgebra, structural properties of the first algebra will alsobe valid in the second one as well.  Thus, the isomorphic versionin the second algebra of a focal element from the first algebrawill be a focal element in the second algebra.  When a union ismade of these two algebras, these two focal elements can remaindistinct, leading to the new algebra now having two focalelements.</P><P>This differs from what must occur with identityelements.  For identity elements there can be but a single identityelement by virtue of the fact that if I and E are both identityelements, then IE = E by virtue of I being an identity elementand IE = I by virtue of E being an identity element.  HenceI = IE = E and so I and E must be one and the same element.</P></BODY></HTML>
