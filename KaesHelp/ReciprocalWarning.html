<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Reciprocal Warning</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Reciprocal Warning</H1><P>The 'reciprocal property' asserts that when an equation ispart of a kinship terminology, then the reciprocal equation derivedfrom the equation is also an equation for the terminology.  Forexample, in the AKT, the equation Parent of Parent-in-law = 0 (i.e., isnot a kin term) has as its reciprocal equation Spouse of Grandchild =0.</P><P>The equation suggested by the KAES program is the reciprocalequation for an equation already in the algebra.  Thus, rejecting thisequation is tantamount to rejecting the reciprocal property for theterminology structure being modeled by the algebra.</P></BODY></HTML>
