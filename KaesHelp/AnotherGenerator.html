<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Another Generator</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Another Generator</H1><P>The KAES program has not been able to find any element in thealgebra that is, or can be, a reciprocal element for the newlyentered generating element.  Hence, yet another generating elementmay need to be introduced, with this element defined to be areciprocal element for the generating element in question.  For example,when the algebraic model for the AKT is begun with the identity element,I, and the generating element, P, the algebra so generated will notyet have any element that can be a reciprocal for P.  Thus anothergenerating element, call it C, is introduced and the equation, PC = I,is included in order to make P and C reciprocal elements.</P></BODY></HTML>
