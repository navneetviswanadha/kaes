<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Reflexive Equation</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Reflexive Equation</H1><P>Since products with the kin term become reflexiveafter n products, an equation will be needed in the algebracorresponding to this property of the kin term map.  TheKAES program has suggested an equation that will make thealgebraic element that corresponds to the kin term reflexivein the algebra after n steps.  Select Yes if this equationshould be made part of the algebraic structure.</P></BODY></HTML>
