<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Collapse Cousins</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Collapse Cousins</H1><P>Many native users of the American Kinship Terminologycollapse all "cousin positions" and use a single, covering term,Cousin for any kind of cousin.  This option activates an equationthat maps all cousin "positions" in the algebra (that is, if thealgebraic generators are P and C and correspond to the kin termsParent and Child, respectively, then the "cousin" products are ofthe form, CC . . . CPP . . . P, where the number of C's and P'smay differ but there are at least two C's and two P's in theproduct) onto the single position, CCPP, with the lattercorresponding to the term, Cousin.</P><P>Compare the algebraic structure with the kin term map to seeif all of the "cousin" elements in the algebraic structure shouldbe collapsed onto a single "cousin" element.  This kind of collapsingcorresponds to the elimination of the "Ith Cousin"  and the "J TimesRemoved" part of the Cousin nomenclature in the AKT.</P></BODY></HTML>
