<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Isomorphic Comparison</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="white"><H1>Isomorphic Comparison</H1><P>The next step is to test whether or not the algebraic modeland the kin term map are isomorphic as structures.  The KAES programwill indicate that the user should return to the Main menu andselect the Comparison option to test whether or not the two structuresare isomorphic.</P><P>The two structures are isomorphic if it is possible to makea correspondence between the nodes in the two structures in sucha manner that arrows of a given kind linking nodes in one structureare matched by arrows or a corresponding kind linking thematching nodes in the other structure.  Isomorphic structures, thendiffer only in labling of nodes, not in the form of thestructure.  When the algebraic model and the kin term map areisomorphic, then any consequence of a kin term product can be"translated" into a statement about the binary product foralgebraic elements, and conversely.  Because the algebraicstructure has been generated from atomic elements and certainequations, it follows that the kin term map can be so generatedas well.  The algebraic elements that are the generating elements,when mapped to their kin term equivalents, also define which ofthe kin terms are generating terms for the kin term structure.</P><P>From a mathematical perspective, isomorphism is proven asa logical consequence of the structures in question.  Proof in themathematical sense cannot be used here since only the structureof the algebraic model has been specified and the goal of theanalysis is to use the algebraic model to specify how the kinterm structure can be viewed as a structure generatable fromatomic terms, certain equations, etc.  Instead of a proof, theKAES program uses a constructive method.  First, the linkagebetween generating elements for the algebra and kin terms ismade.  Normally the KAES program is able to work out thecorrespondence without any input from the user based onstructural properties of the algebra and the kin termmap.  Second, after the correspondance is made, the KAESprogram begins at the focal element for the algebra and thefocal term for the kin term map and then traces all possible pathsfrom the focal element using all possible arrows connectingnodes.  The KAES program traces through the kin term map in acorresponding manner, if possible.  If it is possible to tracethrough all nodes and arrows in the algebraic structure, and ifafter doing so all terms and arrows in the kin term map have alsobeen traced (using a fixed mapping between elements and terms,and between arrows of a specified kind in the algebraic structrureand a corresponding type of arrow in the kin term map), then thetwo structures are isomorphic.</P></BODY></HTML>
