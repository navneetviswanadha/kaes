For example, inthe American Kinship Terminology, the term Brother maps Brother back ontoitself: Brother of Brother = Brother.  In terminologies where upward arrowsused repeatedly eventually reach a limit with respect to new kin termpositions, the upward arrow is typically reflexive for the terminalterm.  This differs from the possibility where the upward arrowapplied to the terminal kin term does not yield a kin term.  For example,in the American Kinship Terminology if the upward arrow representstaking products with the kin term, Parent, then Parent of Parent-in-lawis not a kin term, hence there is no upward arrow (reflexive or not) fromParent-in-law in the kin term map for the AKT.</P></BODY></HTML>
